Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Sit still and close your eyes 
What's behind the other door? Oh-ohh
No more silence 
Don't kill this thing we got called love 
Just searching for the perfect shot


When love comes calling don't look back
When love comes calling don't look away
When love comes calling don't look back
When love comes calling don't look away


I used to write rhymes all day and all night
When y'all was playing PlayStation my pencil was erasing lines
My conscience only knew what's half-tight
At 3:14 it's time to get me a slice my nigga
This is a dog's fight my nigga
The soundtrack to life my nigga
Kendrick Lamar his momma called him that
He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
He sold Sega games his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks his uncles pumped packs
Punk fake jump-shot ball hit the back
Ball dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack
That's because these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga I stole a bible is that a sin?
Part of me though I'm searching for answers 
The good kid from the ugly city that's mad that he's had some
Where is the love?


When love comes calling don't look back
When love comes calling don't look away 
When love comes calling don't look back
When love comes calling don't look away


Give me rings give me chains mayne
Give me a blue Benz red Porsche red Range
Give me black bitches white hoes new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some landa or maybe I'll land a
G5 clear port say hello to the man
Give me awards Grammies and let the crowd applaud
my name till they strain the veins in they vocal chords
Give me fame and fortune me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said give me Tiger's sports endorsements
Give me billboards whatever that people would kill for
Manhattan at 40/40 no forties but rose poured
Give me vanity give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be
Give me horror like Amity no give me the charts 
And if you ever renege I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar
This is me and that's love


When love comes calling don't look back
When love comes calling don't look away
When love comes calling don't look back
When love comes calling don't look away


Now everybody smoke to it
for this is lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Gimme that beat fool
This a full time jack no really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it when you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me
Nah I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged a medium away from livin' large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad pussy you fucked with the wrong one I'm on one I'll make sure your kids breathe ammonia
Good kid mad city evil in my heart from the blood niggas fuckin' with me crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state if I raise the crime rate it's a legitimate reason why I put on repeat Kanye's 
But I'll be looking passed that I'm tryna touch god
My heart to the heavens the rebel of the reverend
Ya'll married to the game well I'm bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you goin' through something this is shit you recite
This is bigger than life
This is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tall  I mean war like that
Yeah straight like that




In 2010 I'm tryna ball nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate
Shall stay anonymous
Searchin' 7 continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies-homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga
My nigga Tony said "just do you nigga!"
Sure improve nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure till they know you got the stankiest stew nigga!
I ain't trippin' I'm just tippin' on fo-fo's back in the city and tippin' on 4 hoes
That boy got a cold cold
He's sick con slick on
Drop red jewels like a school bar mitzvah
Ooooh
Straight like that




Why ya'll complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop not Dre not Ice Cube
I don't care me and quik went to the same school
I look at the mirror and do it myself like a self made nigga
I don't need a maid nigga
Do I need a cosign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger but do I need em though?
I just made a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost  on you motherfuckers
I got my back against the wall and a .45 dog get smoked Chris Tucker
Uhh tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talkin' bout?
I look at your Audemars to put ya'll in time out
It's time to unveil the real and your careers bout as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute brother  and pull the wine out
Oooh lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Oh what up hoe? Oh what up?
I said oh what up hoe? Oh what up?
I said oh what up hoe? Oh what up?
Well alright


I'm going through something with life
Where pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron that's some great advice


Welcome to my diary stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me rather than society's
Woes let me go let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist got me fired ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life nigga!
You gon' make me flip then split yo' shit judge give me life nigga!
Pain since my grandma's death uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream
So while I go through all-this-all-this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry




I said keep reading my diary when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills credit card late fees
Capital One popping up on my caller I.D.
Pawning my chain in the shop watching for hollow tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man that's my worst fear ain't that your worst fear?
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality takes toll
Open up your contacts then scroll 




Welcome to my diary hmm where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt a turtle in a turtleneck
Convertibles with turbo jets fueled by 7 Up and Prometh'
I feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot tequila hit me like a nina 
My sky's gray my bitch is brighter
Always saying  J. Cole's her ghostwriter
And I'm the God MC join my diocese
Free ya mind don't mind so-ciety
And finally everyone got their own problems
Everything's subject to change like broken dollars
I'm a drown in my drink and swim in woman's vagina
Like a Pirahna fin lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










One time
Reporting live Compton California

She go to work she go to school
Her body smooth no tattoos
Type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too she's compatible
She's independent she handle her business
She believe in God and no other religions
Never in competition when it comes to her friends
She's dependable she set her own trends
A confidant a mediator
So sweet every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor
Look at her hips I want to be her pager
Conservative affirmative
Action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her a blind man could see
A true queen and she needs me
She needs me she needs me
She needs me she needs me
The beauty of her swear to God a blind man could see
A true queen and she needs me


That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together we are roller-coasting on on on


Five years later an accounting major
Work at a firm abundance of paper
She got a career she look in the rear-
view mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Private bars executive meetings
Consecutive trips vacation on weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress
Probably the only product of a pure success
Got a promotion now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building
Real estate property
She do tender steak only one mouth to feed
Funded a youth center invested in some stock
Doubled what she put in then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl how great life can be
and though she got the world she needs me
She needs me she needs me
She needs me she needs me
Oh what a girl wonder how her life can be
and though she got the world she needs me




We lose touch separated
Years pass I'm out dating
She's dating one of Hollywood's
famous of entertainers Denzel good
Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping
Tuesday morning brunch Benihana's
Tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you
Emmy Awards Academy too
On the red carpet dress matching his suit
She holding his arm she wave at her moms
then wave at the world got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds star-gazing
Caught her on the stage a proposal was waiting
He bent down got on one knee
She looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me she needs me
She needs me she needs me
Even if we seem to separate eventually
it'll come to pass lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








See y'all don't understand me
My plan be is to win y'all hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee that young boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
the way he piece up troopers then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did I stand for what I believe in
Family God and honor
From Chicago my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king reign supreme named Kendrick
I ain't lying it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
from the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison but Gucci manhood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am y'know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest nigga
And if you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
until I finally realised that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'ma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor but still I remain focussed
In due time I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
and admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'ma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ate tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard


Yep yep that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs 
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I re-up cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say I'ma be heard


What up Dasan? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first that's what's for sure
At the church recording at the garage but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I wrong I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning yawning but I was on it
Me you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard




So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Does it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random but my humor sometimes strays like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy but I'm a  one
with Jesus Christ passion I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you that's your bad
because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer but I can heal the city
My niggas tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk then let it bump so I can be heard
Yeah uh huh




D-Dave lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this


Uh I used to to wanna by like Michael Jordan
Figured that I'd hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
5-0-1s Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only five momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
that every Section 8 tenant is familiar with? Ooh wee
They say he something like the seventies but I'm from '87
With a thousand dimes you got eighty sevens
Gourmet sneakers hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers that was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A billion bucks and that's why


The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this


She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control no I don't trust it hoe
Uh so give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign that's a cheap stamp
You niggas' check's cash
And I'm GT crashing 1-0-5 off rap
Ay that lil' nigga got it going on
G5 going-going-going gone
Cloud nine mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G fuck skip to Y




She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
Say she on birth control no I don't trust it
Aooow~! First off I'm a rider bitch
Put them twenty-sixes on a Silverado bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers she'll go and find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product round town Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Okay Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you pay me paper over pussy nigga
When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy nigga


Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply seven days later
after I wrote him "stay strong keep your faith in God"
what I told him hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being twenty-one
Doing time in the pen and your gramp's old
Your brother's getting older and the streets is getting colder
and you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell it's been thirty weeks
Ain't received any mail it's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write I can only imagine
Jason Keaton I can only imagine yeah


Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it


Sitting on the couch that was my Uncle Bobby
after he just got out fifteen years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together or whatnot
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight got a place found some serenity
Found a job found his mother gravesite found a forty ounce
Then he found God then he bounced
Then he found a new chick two kids wide hips
Found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shacked with her an investment
Then found guilty somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle was working with two strikes
Only out a year now facing life I can only imagine
That's fucked up I can only imagine Uncle Bob




Sitting on the couch thinking bout the ratio
of blacks in prison it's compact in prison
when blacks packed with minorities system grab more of these
eighteen-year-olds eighteen-year sentence
with no parole the state won't oversee
They make the term severe a conspiracy
That's what I call it it's full of shit a toilet can help quick
The government help? No just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there yeah it's justice for all
But ninety-percent unfair care? Nah
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand
with intentions to expand more prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business imagine
We being used imagine lyrics

Cloud nine Kendrick Lamar uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker I'm a thinker call it what you want
But if you turn your back know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit my life is so fucked up man I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again


What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much understood? Where is your faith?
Oh faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed


Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again




Kendrick I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works yeah murk it... 
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas ensue
The rat's lurking vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice




This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers that's human nature you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is lyrics

"Boarding completed
I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
and we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"

Uh coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself you get an F for effort
Ha-ha I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness I'm Cadillac's grandson


And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
cause I'm a trip

Landing on another runway fly with me
or die tryna fly a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy nigga we on
like we never been off straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra she clean off my dishes
then wear off the Kangols hood rats I hate those
And she know what this is hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself get off the stage 
Nigga I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't I gotta be that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son pay homage
or pay attention open your eyes and hear knowledge



Gi-give me that gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel left his ride smoking
on some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low don't you know Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind people don't say nothing



"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Uh-uh-uh what up?
Uh I'm tryna what up?
Uh-uh I'm tryna get something
Uh-uh-uh I'm tryna what up?
I say what up?
Uh-uh I'm tryna

Sometimes I wanna leave sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth sometimes I wanna lie
Sometimes I wanna school the youth sometimes I wanna ride
Sometimes I wanna not think sometimes I wanna vibe
Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out this song bout a young boy
that's going wild inside when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
We kill the facades we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much if my clothes is new
if my ride is plush if my hair is cut if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reach the price scan
that's not about the right price but more like the right scam
to rule us all confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
in a Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? Then I rewind
A time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are farther you from the white man's home
Negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity they parted our families
They put us in hundred-degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in the cage our freedom was so fake
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross uh!
And school was exempt see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt wound diversed from a scar
Four-hundred years of nothing four-hundred years of suffering
Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?
Call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit
of happiness we captured these feelings in things that we do
Thought it's abstinence in slavery but we made it come to
a modern perspective my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her handbag gotta be Gucci it's fake then she foobie
She still bad though and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to twenty-sixes out there riding Kobes
My cousin from the South slavery start in the South and I bet ya
he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
Slaves

Uh I say the four-hundred years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over-exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got four five six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fo's on it
and on the back of the window it says 
You're a vanity slave
We all vanity slaves
and with that being said can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here
Hey Ali where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga you know the first of the month
You know them checks come in
I'm tryna get something lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em a handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life motherfucker I tried
What? Uh


You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma your poppa only person is you
Not your brother your sister the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody nobody but you
So it feels like like it's only you


So I'm feeling like I want to I want to
I want to I want to go so far from here
Very very far from here
I need to I need to
I need to I need to go so far from here
Very very far from here


It seems like you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be 
Sitting pursuing but your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling hard to explain
When you just just want to get away
Something like






Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch now I'm thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head higher than a dread
as I fly through the galaxy pain and the agony
Nothing is surrounding me living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Reporting live from Compton California
North Cackalack

Now everybody just bow to the greatness or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar know how to maul with my wrist
Shout to writers for holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch get busy
I'm busy taking over the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live come to the harvest welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa boo-yaa no one I've done situated myself I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping but I ain't tripping swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window down
like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would


A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
Kendrick show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop
Big Pooh show these muh'fuckers how we rock


Yo it's evident I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired quietly been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
off to the next you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
to celebrate the life Rosie no longer here
I swear




Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even zoos can beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer so I've got to represent the
city like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney this is my sickest winter
since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers 


U-P-S I 
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter all guts no glory
Station on repeat they retread the same story
New niggas bore me tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








We on Ali? You ugly
Everybody just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself just show me you're real
Middle fingers up


Just let me be me hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me hmm
That's the only way I know


Uh I just wanna be me
No disrespect but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
but I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold my style making my nose run
Oh I stare at the mirror then realize
that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests yes



And yeah I know I'm from Compton Cali'
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha-ha-ha I like to joke got a sense of humor?
Stale face play me short like an Oompa-Loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man people who killed man
But my character never could be like them man
And they respect that say that I'm real man
Not a fake person that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film man?
I ain't acting out shit I be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho' and oh



Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photo book to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killers chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want that was wrecking my brilliance
My mama said boy that don't sound like you
I said this is the sound though my only excuse
Quite frankly dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt a diamond in winter
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it




Kendrick Lamar what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Is this really you? Is this who you are?
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that I never had but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be fronting hmm
Cooking in a laboratory hoping I can tell a story
that the whole world can feel like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all I could say is will the radio care?
Yeah or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old
Well that was me then now I'm an adult
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show but I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn soon as my record spin
I wanna be the highest on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring the stress the violence
The capital punishment the loud police sirens
Too focussed one word righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
And that means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed one word 
Mm yeah
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed one word


Too focussed too focussed one word
Too focussed too focussed one word
Too focussed too focussed one word
Too focussed one word
Too focussed too focussed lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
because it will reveal to you why it is true
that whatever the mind can conceive and believe the mind can achieve
regardless of how many times you have failed in the past
or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"


Go getter with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last I checked y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself
then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer I wanna be a Gates


Take your time it'll come
Just stay focussed and humble my son
Show and prove prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it


What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and blasting?
Better yet rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging
Catch him at the light snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop five bricks of the yay head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to the gate
Let the clips distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three-to-six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer I wanna be a Trump
Donald that is




And when I do it I do it again then I go back
When I do it I'll do it again then I go back
Thug it out but for now I'm willing to dug it out
I gotta grind grind


So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife
Pop's engine in this old school run tight!
But as you listening to K. D-O-T
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say
Damn these niggas that much better than me?
Baby I don't think this is meant to be
cause I'm always losing self-esteem
She paused the iPhone then said huh
I repeated what I said then she replied shut up
You know you the best boy you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist be more like Jay
Russell Barry Gordy Quincy Jones
Bob Johnson Sean Combs L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed yeah
So I gotta see success
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop and I'll pop on whoever's in my way




Yeah I swear to God I don't wanna do it just live man
I wanna live good
Just wanna make my momma proud y'know?
I don't wanna be hard I don't want the most stripes
I got lil' brothers and sisters man I'm the oldest nigga
I just want it lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










I'll tell you what I don't believe in can I do that?
Alright I don't believe in the in laws or the system by any means whatsoever
I try not to obey them at any time
That's what I believe in not believing in

Four big bottles of water a day two packs of Marlboro Reds and
uh what keeps me alive? Shit um
Music I have to listen to music all day long
I say that keeps me going
I'm a pretty dark person I've thought about ending it a million times
and I have to say that music keeps me here by far the main thing


Thank you
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now freestyle or write down whatever
And still I come up clever I just need to free my thoughts
and Lord knows that I know better but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead die trying and know death
Might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have and victory tastes sweet
even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones but where I'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me rap about life not rap niggas
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissing
My stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up would just come up
We used to beefing over turf fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Compton lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap Saran our defiance ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listen to  and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice I ain't lying
I swear to God half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block he got shot you wouldn't know I witnessed
You just mind your bidness
You just turn your head kneel down and then tie your tennises
It's kinda scary ain't it
You can't act like no bitch that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this why you pick up that stainless?
Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him
so much you probably had your burner tucked in graduation
Said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him facing
twenty-five to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if my record never break I still won't break my promise I promise to keep it honest
Secret society all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like the Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month
Alright? Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans & Central trying to duck the central bookings
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking never will I surrender
I've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different
They said seven tracks I said fifteen
Called it an EP they said I'm tripping
But little did they know I'm tryna change the rules
that we've been confined to so the corporate won't make decisions
Uppity bitches handling bidness
Killing our dreams stealing our vision
Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home
In L.A. everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most y'all cats just don't know Kendrick
You barely know yourself so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain't doing this for my health I'm just trying to purchase my momma them businesses
Occupy my time with riches justify my time ambition's
just to coincide just to go inside books we idolize while we living
Look the mastermind took the master's mind just the perfect time just to mastermind
Just to master grind with precision look the mastermind took the... 


We would like to call this an appreciation tape
for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP
For this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D.
Because of you lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now


Smoke to it nigga smoke to it nigga




That's what she said to me
That place I used to call home is just a bed to me
and we don't even sleep neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I'm in these streets with everybody
I'm trying to get it and she know they got me I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don't reach you I hope these lyrics in sync




That's what it said to me
But that place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten I'm off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm bout to drop the ball
I'm calling out for help my engineer called
Told me come to the studio I wanna tell him nah




That's what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me
Only a hundred and forty-four can go
Seven billion people on planet earth today
Is there something that I don't know?
I know to follow him rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means I'm following evil
Guess I'm following evil I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don't need you




So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what's important in my life I apologize
I promise to stay faithful focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action? It's just a part of life
And if your vision's impaired you probably lose it all tonight


I'm trying to visualize how to get it right
But my vision's so blurry
Trying to slow it down stay close to the ground
But we're always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world stand a little slower
Then I would lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








I remember uh
All my uncles Sir Smokers
on the landra in front of our building
They was my heroes


This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
Bad bitches crackheads street niggas crackheads
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead

Uh and that's scary to me
Dope beat dope flow vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps
Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward I'ma serve you some +keys+
This is crack cocaine I'm Kurt Cobain
and I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-R-I-U high you I'm an I-V
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack... stop
I said an I-V cause when I be
in the studio high shot a needle in your vein
Take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey I hate chickens
but I do fuck pretty birdies where your girl at?
Over the Pyrex where my world at



Uh and that's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Disease on K-Dot? Uh uh better wake up
A nightmare I'm right there like a Siamese
twin when you motherfuckers gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eyedrops
I BIG I 'Pac you Chris I +Rock+
That's pookie hom' New Jack head-first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone who you got to tell on?
If it ain't about me about hoe
or be about face if you ain't no higher learn it
There's soda in the pot and the fire burning



Uh and it's scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track it's a Reynolds wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap rapping heat
You could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet I suppose
This is bigger than life
This is probably everybody Illuminatis
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice
of the party I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab

Gina I'm ass-out" 




Oh what up hoe? Oh what up?
I said oh what up hoe? Oh what up?
I said oh what up hoe? Oh what up?
Well alright


I'm going through something with life
where pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron that's some great advice


Welcome to my diary stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me rather than society's
woes let me go let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist got me fired they rushed us then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life nigga!
You gon' make me flip then split yo' shit judge give me life nigga!
Pain since my grandma's death uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best let it go trench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream
So while I go through all-this-all-this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry 





"So what you wish me over here for?
How was your day?
Are you tipsy?"
Mhmm


All I need in this lifetime pussy and Patron
Give me that won't you give that? Once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean tell your baby mama what it do
Where your friends at? I got long dick what it is
Go on poke it out situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot on my grind all ready
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
When you let me when you let me...


Give me that funk that sweet that nasty
That good shit stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you blame it on the liquor babe
Give me that funk that sweet that nasty
That good shit stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you...


Uh I wrote this song when Dave drove home
and caught that flat in the  flats
And it made me think when another car blinked
to change locations where we at
We often get lost in the ever-hard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain problem and sorrow
Just for a minute then back to the bullshit
Your car now due and you bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely Patron pussy make it feel alright
But once it's empty and the bitch leave then it's back to life
You can't run from it gotta run to it nigga
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga
But still you proceed to dive deep ask what's her zodiac sign




Okay welcome to my diary hmm where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step man I hate to work for them
One time I tried to work for me but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am stressing questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving traffic jam wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open bust that pussy open
'Soul balls deep ya dig?
Retrieve relief ya dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
and lie butt-naked telling the truth would ya?
What's up? I had a long day and I really want to fuck
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
cause all I've been thinking the whole day...




All I need in this lifetime pussy and Patron
Give me that won't you give that? Once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean tell your baby mama what it do
Where your friends at? I got long dick what it is
Go on poke it out situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot on my grind all ready
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
When you let me lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









She look better than Beyonce Alicia Keys Halle Berry Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. that girl's an alien
And if I die before I wake I pray that I'm in outer space
U-F-O fly away
So let's go-go-go-go let's go-go-go-go
Let's go-go-go-go let's go let's go


Uh she got me going I'm all in
Fifty stories I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still I feel ya
Energy is sending me toward the ceiling
I'm high now are you up there?
If you was I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare I mean wow
and I'm wowed no one compares
A one-on-one you must have won
every pageant in America when you was young
Lips hips hair drip down her back crazy
Body frame crazy insane crazy
The only girl that can make time then make me stop




Uh so now we on so now we gone
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off I stunt with her
We do it sweet they look bitter
Look at her get up I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause I'm addicted and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
Gotta be an odyssey from Heaven way above
You definite not probably I gotta give it up
Lips hips hair drip down her back crazy
Body frame crazy insane crazy
The only girl that can make time lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics












Uh yeah 
Uh
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us love people...
I'm inspired so get inspired

And so he said why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con-artist? Why you couldn't
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up when I'm completely giving up?
Or when niggas holler what's up you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me? Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you sometimes


We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
(Sometimes I sometimes I feel we share
nothing in common it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall?
Where do we seem to fall?
Tender love and care once upon a time
Once upon a time we was there)


And so she said why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying hi daddy?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still love my ex?
Every time we get into it I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me you gon' leave me that's your favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after your homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me? Sometimes




She says she loves me she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like sometimes when I have things on my mind she's the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice she says when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning
she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me
She says she needs me she says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower
she's standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off
She says she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says lyrics

I used to want to be like Michael Jordan
Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune


Uh every time I'm in my city I be hacking like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping  hello world Kendrick here
And I'm too/two much for these niggas I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce hoe bounce-bounce


This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
or fuck my enemy's bitch acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on them twenty-sixes I'm a vanity slave
I'm a sinner Jesus Christ please forgive me for my ways
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
I'm a Comp-town representer concrete backflipper
A.K.A. that nigga don't worry
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
This is HiiiPoWeR since the Eddie Bower I've been popular
I'm popping now every other hour paparazzi come
You jocking her let her be a hoe why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic what you know bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
See too many of y'all getting money know my turn coming
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why... "Hey wait a minute motherfucker"


Every time I'm in my city I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping  hello world Kendrick here
And I'm too/two much for these niggas I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch Michael Jordan bitch
That means I'm too/two much for these niggas I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes


Man the game chose me what am I to do?
Only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking down to Fred Segal put my girl on it
Ass so fat probably sit the world on it
Ay pussy crazy pussy crazy
You fuck niggas you pussies crazy
Man I know I can't tell you bout the world homie
But I know I can tell you bout your girl homie
Her pussy's crazy her pussy crazy
I fucked nigga I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it  once it haul ass
Give me tall glass Coconut Ciroc
Please no soda pop I make my solo pop
Life's a bitch her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me




I remember tripping walking through the set like my Glock don't think
Grandma in the kitchen neck bones in the sink
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't why you sucker niggas can't see
I'm from Hoover mayne high as Supermayne shit you Lois Lane
You pussy mayne with the pussy game shit we off the chain
We popping ay fortune not the fame shit you backwards mayne
You chasing hoes we replacing those bag and pass them hoes
Your broad that chose yes she moving on yep we do it wrong
We fuck the homes fuck the center home marijuana strong
You know I'm gone turn my swagger on am I swagged enough?
My paper long yep you left alone you gets none fucks
Leaning off the Actavis passing blunts round and round
Told Mary/merry was a  so we passed her  and 
Your bitch texted me wants it now so I had to knock her down
Work her bouncing on my balls slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide I hit home-runs clean her dugout till I'm done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy's crazy lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Lord forgive me


Kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand
Then jump back in that mini van double back to his block
And blam I ain't backing down for nothing
I'm a back em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single man
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner
Coroners comfort your mama mama he's dead
The next morning high toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting
No sympathy ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
Protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
Cause ignorance is bliss


This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge but never will I dish off
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off
Then peel off in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street
Indubitably I'm a do me
Better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak but just give me 2 weeks
And I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect dammit or get damaged
Die young corpse identified by your parents
Apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
Stop it I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves that ignorance is bliss


And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge but never will I dish off
This my world I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard
I'm so-Cal you so called
Rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off
I show up to show out to show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down boggins
Backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
You gon' tip her
Cause ignorance is bliss
And Willy B I'm a fool on yo beats lyrics

This is me thinking at 4:43 AM June 6

Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping I need money now
like should I start trapping? If what I write down
don't connect this very moment then I'm on it no question
In the streets my niggas is well connected let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush Promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
This is me frustrated battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga what you doing on these corners with me?
 Well I guess my nigga I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 hinges
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff I need a new solution
Curve-serving know I might be in your store boosting
two-elevens with MAC-11s like fuck Hip Hop
Don't wanna be Pun don't wanna be B.I.G. don't wanna be 'Pac
Just give me your funds A.K.A. everything that you got
or everything getting shot for nothing
Leave you in shock coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam water
Sherm contraband they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse verses get let off in thirty minutes six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly where I put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie if you knew me
you'll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing
But lately I've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do no shit
So I tell my nigga front me let me put it on the strip
Then give it back when I think about the consequence shit


There are times when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling cause there is a light that shines
special for you and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
before they pass they pass they pass
Pass me by oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

One time
Reporting live Compton California

Have you ever felt like like you never get life?
Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep
Back down backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
Oh what a cold world for a broke nigga it's bitter
and life's a bitch don't hit women so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so  like Nas' first name
And back they'd tell me it's very difficult to see twenty-five
and if I survive I probably wouldn't sell it
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto rather in some heals like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed until I hit the streets
for filling voids of broke D-boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige till I live with the blues
B.B. King or the neighbors of Snoop


That's why I'm in the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life life life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie lie lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past

{We are we are fighters
We are we are true
Through the through barbed wires
We will will break through}
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past



Have you ever felt like like you never get life?
Like you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep
Tryna get away from the world stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
She desperately in need of some inspiration see what the people saying
She gon' have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of sixteen credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye boyfriend brutality
She will never get by no how no way
Welfare recipient property of the state
Housing Section 8 corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute the niggas tell her that she cute
Hoodrat trashy six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamies waiting on the first
Fast-forward spilling drinks on her fur


That's why she in the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life life life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie lie lie
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past

{We are we are fighters
We are we are true
Through the through barbed wires
We will will break through}
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past



Have you ever felt like you finally got life?
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off your  like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat
of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like you just hit the lottery my God
There must be a God cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions got an independent business mind
And both of y'all are steady grinding doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out


In the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life life life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gon' tell you that's a lie lie lie
So even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad
Know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path



Just laugh then everybody say


Cause I won't get caught again
and I'm here to start the trend
You can't catch me if you try
Disappear into the night lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you to know me within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary relatives in high school
With that being said each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head I needed survival
Got jumped got jacked shot at shot back
And I don't even push a line I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and.. real talk and


This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do y'know?)
I'm no gangster no killer I'm just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up and I was like hold up
Where you from? 
Where you stay?  that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five they said they already knew
What happened and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball opened up the door then got in
Somebody said fall back we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals fuck but


This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
I'm no gangster no killer I'm just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through but I've been through it now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed you smoke that but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words we get it cracking but I keep it cool y'know?


This is why they fuck with me 
This is why they fuck with me 
I'm no gangster no killer I'm just your average Joe 
But one thing you should consider lyrics

H.O.C. H.O.C.

Everybody know I spit that hunk of shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth then shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab you should bob and weave
like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five you saying I can level more?
In high school my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
creation of man and Columbine


Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
I don't even smoke I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your endo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke I don't even smoke

Look nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They new booties they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for forty days
forty nights off the chain like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted like forty gays
My flow worth the earth that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me like my son's bout to win
Somehow someday and I don't care when
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale/in hell like an atheist



Uhh I'll take you back to the ninth grade
when Dough Boy had me high for four days
That's my nigga he a street nigga
Probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
I didn't listen I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
Just underline every letter
Capital K-D-O-T letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks and what you bout?
Nothing huh? Am I square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah




H.O.C. H.O.C.

Uh-uh-uh uh uh-uh-uh uh
Ali you thirsty on Twitter 
You boo-boo you T
You turned down you thirsty
You boo-boo

Uh I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings
and if I speak the good into existence that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight who wearing a weave
Who Dooney & Bourke bag is fake who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve bitch I'ma cut you off


Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop blase-blah
He say she say oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop blase-blah
He say she say

Uh I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas motivation
It's more than making enemies my nigga
Oh that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
on how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga?
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed him at the Monte Crystal
Where so-and-so from and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing bringing me down
Speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger pussy nigga I'ma cut you off


Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop blase-blah
He say she say oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop blase-blah
He say she say

Uh I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa studying art
Now paint that picture life behind bars
Remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays left my uncle in prison
For fifteen years no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people dang
And if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would probably cut y'all off too yep


Cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop blase-blah
He say she say oh my God
Shut the fuck up... keep it running Ali
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop blase-blah
He say she say

So tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah bitch you boo-boo you T
You turned down you thirsty
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah nigga you boo-boo you T
You turned down you thirsty
You thirsty you boo-boo
You T you turned down
You boo-boo you T
You boo-boo you turned down
You thirsty you T
You boo-boo you turned down
You boo-boo you T
You turned down you weak
You weak yo' bitch weak
Yeah 
You boo-boo you T 
Keep all that


What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think the way we live
See it's known today that the human race is nothing
No moral no standards
What we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
No you don't have to have a lot of money
You don't have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it's as big as a crew some say it's as big as a gang

"My nigga what it look like?"


Niggas hating bitches hating babies dying
Bullets flying helicopters police sirens preachers lying
Genosism criticism unemployment racism
Burning buildings AIDS victims cancer killing no cure
Oil spilling turmoil poverty-stricken
Police brutality kicking ass of us Africans hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison child molesting
Cow intestines botox injection earthquakes that's government testing
Secret society weapon opium plant manifested
that turn to crack then invest it amongst us blacks just a method
to hold us back great depression amongst Iraq no direction
No google map just a TEC for the soowoo
Swerving Isuzu then blah-blah-blah adolescents go cuckoo
Mothers are boo-boo crying the governor keep us starving
These commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
Supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph distinctive living with science
No place to live in no Zion see that's forbidden we frying

"My nigga what it look like?"
That's exactly what Hell look like uh


Tell it like it is nigga
Tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga
Tell it like it is tell 'em what's up

"My nigga what it look like?"

I miss you where you been?
It's been months and I haven't heard from you I need you
It's been months and I haven't heard from you come back to me
Come back I need you in my life
I miss you I miss you come back to me I miss you


What's up baby? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
different girls different towns
To keep it real you missing out
I'll all bored next city
Random cars TEC's with me
Like I miss you so much have sex with me
Not right now look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that I don't care Dom
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom
Meet me here where Dom?
Get undressed yeah Dom
Yeah Dom what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed?
Good food? Japanese?
That's me on page forty in that magazine
 you need that
She said nobody come close I agreed back
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weed back
and she need me believe that


That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together we are roller-coasting on on on


What's up love? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chiles
Truant like a student you the principal
Schooled me on timing we was both shining
like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond
I was Your Highness you was my queen
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S
for us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher no sir
Wake it back up Folgers posters
By my waistline shout for your hard hit
You called it a hate crime say you want me back
and your girl wanna date Dom that's high school shit
4-0-1 K we could be friends with benefits you dig that?




I upped and walked out now she crying cuz
She need me I got that John Bryan love
Had to find love we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece she was a one-punch
You know a knock-out and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black shrivel up and drop out
There we go again what the fuck you talking bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then couldn't count the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say yep smiling so freely
That was back then but I bet she still need me
She need me she need me
She need me she need me
I would say yes smiling so freely
That was back then lyrics

The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this


Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
with no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of  speaking
Fedora on the top the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus


Huh they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary fuck shit up on top
Say I'm big time Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
on that bandwagon of my genitals not new to me
I'm still serving broads on my chest for gratuity


The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is

Oh Lord here he come there they go again

Burn a swisher up then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy just make sure that dough keep rolling in hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting bitch I do it


Never been like you or wanted to be I do me
She found out that I'm in a group now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah keep it simple stupid all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent city fashion lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing me cause hating we ain't pimping keep our balance




These hoes want to love me mayne
So I'm like what up? Uh what up?
Uh bitch I do this remix stupid fire burning people looting
That's the chaos comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chunking deuces then drop one dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come I just run my city dude
You just make your city run they hate to be next to you
Tables turn say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm bout to make that halo burn goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside of Halle Berry feed me berries in Paris oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha reporting from C-P-T motherfucker

Bitch I do this

The definition what cool is

Gather around
I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen Keisha Tammy come up front
I recognize all of you
Every creed and color
With that being said... fuck your ethnicity
You understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you
All of you


Now everybody throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck throw your hands up high


Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black White Asian Hispanic goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity nigga


Fire burning inside my eyes this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah hypnotize trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck is you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail man I got so much in store
Racism is still alive yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that nigga look at that line it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's and I been there so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention ten-hut! Man I gotta get my wind up
Man I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain then I lost it I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost is penny for my thoughts
Everybody please hold up your wallets
Yeah man I'm the mailman can't you tell man?
Going postal never freeze up when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you oh my
HiiiPower

(Reporting live from Planet Terminator X I am Martin Luther King with an AK-47)


Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black White Asian Hispanic goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity nigga


I'm tired of y'all cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity I'm too involved
I'm no activist I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that Math dropping that science
Like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me I'mma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams get it right
Get a life I got 2 that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy TMI TSA man I'm fly put wings on my back
That a plane or angel? Both like a pilot with a halo whoa... Gross


I mean I've seen so many things come through them him her you
I'm just a messenger yeah I know life's a bitch get the best of her
Put them 3's up they notice that we up HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us they'll die

Wizard

Stewardess complimentin me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers

Eat my asparagus then Im askin her
Thoughts of a young nigga fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds I know you dyin to meet em

Jump off

I never did nothin but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that Im easily peddlin with the speed of a lightnin bolt
As a kid I killed two adults Im too advanced
I live my twenties at two years old the wiser man
Truth be told Im like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire wit devils holdin hands
From the distance dont know which one is a Christian damn
Who can I trust in 2012? Theres no one
Not even myself a Gemini screamin for help somebody

The King of Diamonds wit diamonds I never do ask for
They checkin my passport Im too accustomed with Customs
She call in the task force I killed it somebody cuff im
They want me to fast-forward the game and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor youll never hop in my lane
When you pushin a RAV4 you wreckin my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport her feet on the dashboard

Fuck that
8 doobies to the face
Fuck that
12 bottles in the case
Nigga fuck that
2 pills and a half weight
Nigga fuck that
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist

Man I swear
My nigga tripping off the shit again
Pick him up then I set him in
Cold water then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope they take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 80
And you feeling like no one can relate
Cause you are you are
A loner loner
Marijuana endorphins
Make you stronger stronger
I'm in the house party tripping off
My generation sipping cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
PlayStation and some drank
Technology bought my soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep the president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that tab
Is light blue she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got ADHD

8 doobies to the face
Fuck that
12 bottles in the case
Nigga fuck that
2 pills and a half weight
Nigga fuck that

Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it
They always told me ADHD did it

And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby. How old are you?
She say 22 I say 23
OK then we all crack babies
Damn why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'm a tell you later just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up shut the blinds
Closed the screen jumbotron
Made it to the back where she reside
Then she said read between the lines
Yep hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it then she grabbed it
Then she said get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy

Fuck that
8 doobies to the face
Fuck that
12 bottles in the case
Nigga fuck that
2 pills and a half weight
Nigga fuck that
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist

Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it

I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time time time
And girl that's fine but I wanna know do you mind?
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day 
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today
And girl that's fine but I wanna know do you mind-mind-mind-mind?


I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl why so much?
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her but when the makeup occur
I don't see it all I see is a blur




I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
 eyeliner thickens
 figure her vision
(of prettiness the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction) I've outgrown
 your imperfections 
They tell me I need to) smile (at least once in a while
I hate my lips my nose my) eyebrows
(It's the beauty in me but what he don't see
is that I had a black eye)

I know this girl
She a real good girl
And she be low-key
Looking like a star
With a real nice car
A Mercedes key
And she got a nigga
And she love this nigga
Well at least I think
Everytime we bark
She pay us no mind
In the middle of the street
She be like..


Fuck them other niggas cause
I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause
I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas
I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga
Fuck them other..


Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night
She checked his phone Erica right
When he plead the fifth man it was on
Matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone
Was on speed dial so when she got home
It was going down she go..


Fuck that other nigga
When she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga
When she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga
When she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga
Fuck that other..


I know this girl
She a real hood girl
And she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up
Big bamboos
Mike Jordan kicks with that
Big butt but when I try
To holla she don't exist
In her man she trust
So when I holla
She gon resist and her man she trust
So when I walk by her
She be screaming this..




Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night
She checked his pockets
Found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged
She popped his eye
Then ran outside
Then started driving
On the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling she go..




And so these girls
These vulnerable girls
Took they men up
Put em in their world
Their vulnerable world
And just like that it was
Only getting they feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the
Biggest question mark
They curious now
Cause when women get sick of men
They think of a big helping hand
To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over
It'll be alright
The minute she hit the block
And turn left she'll be turning dyke lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one one one one
Whoa-ohhh whoa-ohhh
We make it to twenty-one one one one
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh


I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
There's an even more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics

We're far from good not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
with the top down screaming we don't give a fuck
Drink my forty ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
cause the kids just ain't alright


Oh shit nigga something bout to happen
Nigga this shit nigga this sound like thirty ki's under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it


Welcome to vigilante eighties so don't you ask me
I'm hungry my body's antsy I rip through your fucking pantry
Peeling off like a Xanny examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby washed up
Pussy fix your panties I'm Mr. Marcus you getting fucked uh
You ain't heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a traveling freight train
Are you trained to go against Dracula?
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P-90 like it's the 90s
Bullet to your temple you're homicidal remind me that


Compton Crip niggas ain't nothing to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothing to fuck with
Compton eses ain't nothing to fuck with
But they fuck with me and bitch I love it
Woop-de-woop woop-de-woop-woop woop-de-woop
Woop-de-woop woop-de-woop-woop 
Woop-de-woop woop-de-woop-woop woop-de-woop
Woop-de-woop woop-de-woop-woop 


Let's hit the county building gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down get a six-four better know how to drive it
I'm driving on E with no license or registration
Heart racing racing past Johnny because he's racist
1987 the children on Ronald Reagan
raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch
 You blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress
(Like really out here) He copping some blow hoping that he can stretch
Newborn massacre hopping out the passenger
with calendars cause your day coming
Run him down and then he gun him down I'm hoping that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothing because




Can't detour when you at war with your city why run for it?
Just ride with me just die with me that gun store right there
When you fight don't fight fair cause you'll never win
(Right I had the chopper and I tore they ass up)
Can't detour when you at war with your city why run for it?
Just ride with me just die with me that gun store right there
When you fight don't fight fair cause you'll never win yeah yeah yeah
Whoa whoa whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa whoa whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa whoa whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa whoa whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa


We really out here my nigga you niggas don't understand my nigga
I'm off of pill and Remy Red my nigga lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Smoke good eat good live good 


I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing my daddy tired
I need me a weapon these niggas ride
every minute hour and second ministers tried
to save me how I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway this for my niggas
Uncles twenty-three hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music I wrote hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A MetroPC' phone then you went back in
So when I touch the pen the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right just so you


Smoke good eat good live good 


And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya holler if you hear me


You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich but wealthy there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful the city got my back
Before that I give them my torso
You think about it and don't call me lyrical
cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On  probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio he ain't know
I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it he'll probably be
out of work laid back while he


Smoke good eat good live good 


And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya holler if you hear me


Church is definitely on the move and now that we took it up to the cathedral
cause the ism is enormous you know what I'm talking bout?
We out here rotating under the five Ps
Proper preparation prevents poor performance you know what I'm talking bout?
Doing my thing cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
from the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking bout? Church is definitely on the move
and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar
You know what I'm talking bout?
This is the ism this is the vision you know what I'm talking bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday you know what I'm talking bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move you know what I'm talking bout?
Exercise your ism and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit bitch leave me alone
I'm going big suck my dick
I'm going big suck my dick
I'm going big suck my dick
I'm going big suck my dick
Too many niggas not enough hoes
And some of you niggas acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas acting like hoes


Everything I do is alumni
I'm a take my time I'm a master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up blow up hold up
I seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign
Till I resign on your report
That I done you wrong and I mean to know
My homie never
Nigga right now it's now or never
Nigga right now I'm high as ever
But however...




Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
And they wanna tell me I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit
If he gave me a handout
I'm a take his wrist and break it
Nigga I'm faded off of that Nuvo
Chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces living the Matrix
As them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad
HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash
Old friends I no longer have






I remember when I came out and shit
Man it's been so long since they see my dick
Probably been five months since I seen my seed
God dammit K Dot when it comes to this
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call just a Glock for my vouch
Nigga I was motherfucking outchea
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
When I should've been making bangers
I was somewhere stuck with a flame here
Motherfucker see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year
Can I get a hell yea?
Drop my tear hold my joy show my pride
(Music saved my fucking life
I'm doing right
And you left behind
Feel my pain now I'm styling
Heard this shit I spent a thousand
Different homes different islands)
Dropped my mix-tape and it sold like an album
Reason why I'm...

Going big bitch suck my dick
Yea I'm going big bitch suck my dick
Tell em I'm going big bitch suck my dick
Yea I'm going big lyrics

In time you'll learn this is about you 

Babies from 80s don't know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine some of the feminine
'Member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen
I'm just a nigga from Section.80

Show of hands how many been taking notes?
Good
Leave everything on the table now
On the real
This is your generation

Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars


Uh and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur that's her favorite rapper
Bumping  while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking she start running
like Flo-Jo don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give all to her daddy but she don't know her father that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet




And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
and it's quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park I seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police




And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of the black man white man needing satisfaction
At first it became a practice but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing
through that block away from Lueders Park I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder left her dead raped in the street
Keisha's song

Mm my little sister eleven I looked her right in the face
the day that I wrote this song lyrics

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

 Yessir
 Church
 I killed him
 bitch

And this is rigamortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix in my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax when you begin
And then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph
Into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'm be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate
This fucking parasite




That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
Pharrell got me too many
And cool enough for the 70s
Nigga payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me Jay Rock Soul and Q
Solar system ain't barbeque
Ain't nothing else you can do

 yup yup
 I killed him
 hahaha
 amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson don't ask for your favorite rapper

 yup yup
 I know
 for sure
 amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson don't ask for your favorite rapper

I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners
Won't you send us to Bible study faster
You hypocrit-esque is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds
Don't talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic anybody can see
Any assistance everybody done see
Some persistence recognize I be
Really too vicious the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the streets
Better partition better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin' getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe
Is charged up and the audacity
And y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out you'll see

 yup yup
 I know
 for sure
 amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson don't ask for your favorite rapper

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Check check check check...
It go


Ride to it ride to it cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it die to it
Die to it die to it live your life live it right
Be different do different things don't do it like
he did cause he ain't what you is but we can win
Wait let's get straight to the point


To the meaning of life what's my purpose?
Maybe this earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is Heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me look at me I'm a loser I'm a winner
I'm good I'm bad I'm a Christian I'm a sinner
I'm humble I'm loud I'm righteous I'm a killer
What I'm doing I'm saying that I'm human now people just




It go one two three
Two in the front one in the back seat seat
Seat seat looking for a victim of an AK-47
Hundred round each each each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know I look for the answers later
Make a right there they go sometimes gotta




As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside I wonder if Zion inside the Heavens
A condom a rollie pain a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge on Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you am I right? If I'm wrong you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry bout it
I give 'em back they deposit no money just total silence
I'm running they say I'm wildin' a youngun with lack of guidance
There's hundreds of us with problems more money more drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist that's dealing with life the hardest
That's on my life but regardless I'ma




Yeah life can please ya but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure I lost one of my biggest believers ohh
Close deaths make you think about your life
like if I had the same chance twice what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in Heaven saying they at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord what kind of life is this?
Mama I just wanna sing
Mama said lyrics

"Smoking out pouring up keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball holla at broads at the mall
If he up watch him fall I can't fuck with y'all"
 
 
 


Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
while I'm here and every day I hear
your bullshit self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up in the building we get busy and say
R-I-P Aaliyah R-I-P yep
R-I-P Aaliyah R-I-P yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y
A-H give it up two times
Then give it right back don't blow my high




Look at my life then look at yours
Get some ambition why you bored?
Time will never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward I understand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Sip Don Perignon when we finish we say
R-I-P Aaliyah R-I-P yep
R-I-P Aaliyah R-I-P yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up put a ribbon in the sky
and a button on your lips don't blow my high




Now everybody sing this shit


I'm sending him a four-page letter
and I enclose it with a kiss
And when I write he'll be better
Get it on time


Look at my life and look at yours
Get some ambition why you bored?

What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
There's fire in the street fire in the swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
but I've cops circle the block I puff squares
But I swear one day I'ma stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams? 
One two three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch fuck the penitentiary


Section 80's babies blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell


Lord forbid
The homie got wet so we tryna soak it in
The president is black but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unify the people they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world but we gon' manipulate it
I hope you participating
Aiyyo Dot won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here like back in '04
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
and the system made to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist 'em
We're not victors we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like what if kids were celibate?
Or what is Tammy came across a real man
who didn't play games like chil-dren?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriend's girlfriend let the world end
And everybody tripping off twenty-twelve
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
 but our future's not
That martial law shit drop we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast-food use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public work your lil' nine-to-five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you alive 
And on another note
we focussed like the Hubble Telescope 'Soul


Life is a traffic jam 
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam 
Life is a traffic jam 
Life is a traffic jam 
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam


I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do
Section 80 your son will play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turned one to twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance


What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan and pay off your college degree
and do exactly what you see on TV


True story
Hmm can you repeat that for me 'Soul?


What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now my child come on


See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
because you wonder how I could talk about money hoes clothes God and history
all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
till one day I realised I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in I'm not on inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking centre looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money hoes clothes God and history
all in the same sentence
just know I meant it and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck 'em up Terrace



I watch this fire that we're gathered around
and see that it burns similar to the fire that burns inside you
Section 80 Section 80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No they can't control us no they can't control you
No they can't control us but we control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing you represent something that's bigger than all of us
or our family
Heart honor and represent
This is you this is me lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80 HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental I won't sugar-coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation  that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids writing my own hieroglyphs


Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR


Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak uhh
Them demons got me I ain't prayed in some weeks uhh
Dear Lord come save me the Devil's working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane I need a license
to kill I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids write your own hieroglyphs


Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR


Every day we fight the system
just to make our way we been down for too long
But that's alright we was built to be strong
cause it's our life na-na-nah
Every day we fight the system
We fight the system
We fight the system

We been down for too long
But that's alright na-na-nah


Who said a black man in Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked we was racing with Marcus Garvey
on the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said  the drama it bring
is crazy product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me let's set it off
Cause a riot throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids write our own hieroglyphs


Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Lord God I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name Amen

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is KendrickNo you're handsome."
Whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
"Cool where you stay?"
She said: 
Okay I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?No" she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful

She didn't tell just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well

The summer had passed and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust regardless we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
I wanna come over what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys hopped in the car then oh boy

So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinkin' about that sex thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face and then I see
Two niggas two black hoodies I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick where you at?
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes!

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics




"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe"



I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to
This shit is vital I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourself you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

Aye K-Dot get in the car nigga!
Come on we finna roll out!

Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I feel amazing damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers all my niggas is winners screaming

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches damn I got bitches 
Damn I got bitches wifey girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser yes sir
Put fire to that ass body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches wifey girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga it's go time

It's go time I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say "K you going marry mines"
Beeotch no way beeotch no way beeotch no way beeotch okay
I'm never living life confined I can feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch go play beeotch go play beeotch go play beeotch
I look like OJ killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N I win then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N my city mobbing in the street yelling

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches wifey girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Let it run lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Everybody everybody everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
To this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans
Ya bish

Smoking on the finest dope aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no more aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you out out
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas one pistol and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If its necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with  look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually Im drug-free but shit Im with the homies

(Yea nigga we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies

Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckin niggas
Hop out do my stuff then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact I hop out that mothafucka and be like
Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!)

Its 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
Ill tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses good Lord
They knew we werent from round there
Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didnt like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
Thats ironic cause Ive never been violent until Im with the homies

(Just ridin just ridin)
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin actin a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin really trippin)
Me and the homies
(Just ridin just ridin just ridin...)

Bragging bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didnt make me feel that bad
Im usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up even if we aint got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still nigga what is you saying
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay ay nigga jackpot nigga pop the safe
Ay nigga I think it's somebody in this room
Wait what?
Nigga it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right then made a left then made a right
Then made a left we was just circling life
My mama called   Kicking it
I shouldve told her Im probably bout to catch my first offense with the homies

But they made a right they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot you faded hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city fo real doe Nigga for what?
What that nigga what's that Jeezy song say nigga?

Yea yea that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi.
Wait 'til the sun go down roll out complete the mission drop K. Dot off at his mama van at the park
cause I know he trying to fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what hes not gon' do. Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12 I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Me and my niggas tryna get it ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant ya bish

Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond  came on

Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs

You looking like a easy come-up ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun forever)

And I been hustlin' all day
This a way that a way
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel nah nah

A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel


Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school

You know Big Ballin' With My Homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational

Back to reality we poor ya bish
Another casualty at war ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour ya bish

That Louies Burger never be the same

A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirtin'

Gang signs out the window ya bish
Hoping all of 'em offend you ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun forever)

And I been hustlin' all day
This a way that a way
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel


Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way


Imagine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him

Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do
When you eat cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade bitch

Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass

From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy niggas
Selling drugs but it's all good

Broken promises steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is

In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun forever)

And I been hustlin' all day
This a way that a way
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

 Kendrick just bring my car back man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways.
Look shit shit I just wanna get out the house man. This man on one he feeling good as a motherfucker.
Shit I'm tryna get my thing going too. Just bring my car back.
Shit he faded. He feeling good. Look listen to him!

 Girl girl I want your body I want your body 'cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl girl I want your body I want your body 'cause of that big ol' fat ass.

 See he high as hell. Shit lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Every second every minute man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high hands up high hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room perfume go go


I recognize your fragrance hold up you ain't never gotta say shit uh
And I know your taste is a little bit hmm high maintenance uh
Everybody else basic you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy there's blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari nigga that ain't good game homie sorry
They say conversation rule a nation I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real P.S


You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just what you want
Poetic justice put it in a song
You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just what you want
Poetic justice put it in a song


I really hope you play this 'cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in it don't make sense
Young East African girl you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress ooh
Good God what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real P.S


You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just what you want
Poetic justice put it in a song
You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just what you want
Poetic justice put it in a song


Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it maybe call me crazy we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference it's coherent I can hear it uh-huh
That's your heartbeat it either caught me or it called me uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely yours truly and right before you go blind P.S


You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just what you want
Poetic justice put it in a song
You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just what you want
Poetic justice put it in a song


"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie where is you from? Or it is a problem"

"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for if he don't tell where he come it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up we gon' do it like this OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from OK? You gon' tell me where you from OK? Or where your Grandma stay where your mama stay or where your daddy stay OK?"

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your relations
This is your station baby


Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is just me playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you respect
The good kid m.A.A.d. city




All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic
And finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
? or cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say proof
And you ask 
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: 
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind he know we never respect
The good kid m.A.A.d. city




All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind cause now you ever in debt
To good kid lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!

"Man down where you from nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay huh my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run my nigga"


Brace yourself I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me L Boog and Yan Yan YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly wavin' yo' hand out the window  check yourself!
Uh Warriors and Conans Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's AR's "Ayy y'all duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94 fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess
M.A.A.d city

"Man down where you from nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay huh my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run my nigga"


If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!



Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin' nigga!)
Hood ('Sup Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah how we do


Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin' the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. 


G-yeah cocaine weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s loc
Sherm sticks butt-nakeds
Dip make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra Rosecrans Bullis it's Compton

I'm still in the hood loc yeah that's cool
Shit the hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip we in the hood still
So loc grab a strap 'cause yeah it's so real
Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand


If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
Probably go to the projects I
Live inside the belly of the rough Compton USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what!


M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga pass Dot the bottle damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga that ain't no word
Nigga shut up!
Hey Dot you good lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Pour up  head shot 
Sit down  stand up 
Pass out  wake up 
Faded  faded 

Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in a dark room
Loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

Nigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up  head shot 
Sit down  stand up 
Pass out  wake up 
Faded  faded 

Okay now open your mind up and listen me Kendrick
I am your conscience if you do not hear me
Then you will be history Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

Nigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up  head shot 
Sit down  stand up 
Pass out  wake up 
Faded  faded 


I ride you ride bang
One chopper one hundred shots bang
Hop out. Do you bang
Two chopper two hundred shots bang
I ride you ride bang
One chopper one hundred shots bang
Hop out. Do you bang
Two chopper two hundred shots bang

Nigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up  head shot 
Sit down  stand up 
Pass out  wake up

"Sing About Me I'm Dying Of Thirst"






When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering 
I got em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm a push it wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section.80 the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park I'm followed by a married man a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes I run away and never do miss em
See my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that 
My sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away I'll never fade away
I know my fate and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm a get or die trying I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
Don't ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga this bullshit...


When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed may the wound
Help me mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of wondering when I'm a rest
And you're right your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me





Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't bring her back
Who got the footage? channel 9
Cameras looking it's hard to channel your energy
When you know you're crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power yours is ours
Lay with a snitch die with a coward
Hope we get rich hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot fire is proven
To burn for eternity return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running choirs is humming
Tell us to visit we lying about coming
Now back to business loading the guns in
Back of the Buick your hood is feuding
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See all I know is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted if he provoke
My best days I stress days 
My best days I stress days
Say "Fuck the world " my sex slave
Money pussy and greed what's my next crave
Whatever it is know it's my next grave
Tired of running tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel and I...
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real I'm real I'm really really real 


I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him you love them you love her
You love so much you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself




I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love you love beef
You love streets you love runnin' duckin' police
You love your hood might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?




The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word  but what if I got love
I love them I love when I love her
I love so much I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money power respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real


"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore just calling sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy but don't learn the hard way like I did homieAny nigga can kill a man that don't make you a real niggaRealness is responsibility realness is taking care of your motherfucking family realness is god nigga"




"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom."

"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car but look I ain't tripping. Look the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look you take this music business serious and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."


Sing my song it's all for you 


"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow... I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them but you still rose from that dark place of violence becoming a positive person. But when you do make it give back with your words of encouragement and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Now everybody serenade the new fate of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it
My point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics woulda told you Kendrick got killed and pretend its a massacre
And the masses upon us
And I master being the the master at dodging your honour
And the chapter that read at 25 I will live dormant like 5 in the morning
Then raid your spot while Kendricks performing
And if they take everything know I got


Compton Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine




Still Im at it peel the plastic off it
You could feel the magic
Still Im laughing at the critics talking
I can see em gagging when Im back in the back of my city
Back in the back with a batch Im banging Dre Beats with me
Look where Im at its the murder cap
And Im captain at birth of this gangsta rap
Its a wrap when Im done
And Ive come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mill in a day
Bitch Im from..


Compton Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine


So come and visit the tires screeching
Ambulance policeman
Wont you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki crease and crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where your sword at?
Hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big its Rasputia for you shooters
Kama sutra screaming fuck your position and make you hold that
Im trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know Flex and piru crip tatts

They swarm on me like a beehive hoop in the G ride
From the west to the east side
Know just how Compton roll


And thats a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch
Of course its my decision
I crashed the ports that you report
That you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import them narcotics

You bought it then talked about it when crack hit the speakers
The music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record depending on what you expected
Im sure its bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in


Compton compton
Ain't no city quite like mine


So tell that gangsta throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt Imma take you on that next high
I did exactly what I wanted thats what made them checks fly
In my direction you never question when I said I
Will be a mogul before I visit Tupac and Left Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see ya we gon test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now Im on a red eye
Flying back to my city cause I forever stand by


Compton Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine


Now we can all celebrate we can all harvest the rap artist of NWA
America target a rap market its controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers the hood rich and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush crack that case 10 bottles of Rose
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every muthafucka in here say

Look who responsible for taking Compton international
I make em holla oooooooh

Eh yo Just Blaze good looking homie
(Just Blaze lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Smoking weed with you...
Cause you taught me into...



Every morning when I wake up
Uh money on my mind
Good times and get caked up
Sunshine coming through my blinds I'm living but
Really though it's never enough
10 million that's a must
Living in California everybody wanna visit for...


Women weed and weather
They come for
Women weed and weather
For the women weed and weather
From all around the world for the
Women weed and weather
Women weed and weather

These niggas'll kill for that
Put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that
Me I make mills off that
How the fuck ya'll can't see I ride
When I drive down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes
I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess
For a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up baby gonna lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed


You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living


Women weed and weather
They come for
Women weed and weather
For the women weed and weather
From all around the world for the
Women weed and weather
Got that women weed and weather
Yo it sound clever come and play
Wha-Wha-what more can I say
Welcome to LA


My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
3W's only for a three day run
Bitch take the motherfacking panties off you ain't no nun shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breath
I control California living til I am old
You want to be one to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe cause she in the neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Vorhees boy he
On his job boy he sure be havin' them marks on they marks
Pretty bitches and tyre marks
Let 'em inhale the pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my price
No way hell no uh uh
If I'm wrong than I wanna be right
You want to be one to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women weed weather it's not my fault that it's 82 degrees
And my top peeled off

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living




Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one palm trees
Double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed that's me motherfuck your opinion
How many ways am I killin' 'em
Shit right around a billion
We on it that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck til the morning
Time and I got time and I know that I'm in a position of controlling anything
I buy that ocean I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean
Ain't nobody fucking with this


They want that shit they often fiend
I give it to 'em but in between my time
I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean towards 3 W's and life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type I like 'em brown
Just like my drink the fuck you think
I don't fuck with' no hand me downs
See if you fuck than it's after me
You know how much I'm a make it work?
You know her dress living in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first
Cali

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss

So I'm saying 
So I'm saying 
So I'm saying 
So I'm saying 
So I'm saying 
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscious ask me

Black boy fly
Black boy fly
Black-black boy fly
Black boy fly


I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made a dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall he focused on math
Determination ambition plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly


Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy...


I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly




My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
And shortly I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...
Out of Compton

Thank God...
Black boy fly lyrics

We on?
Aight
1 2 3 go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song I'm so far away
From the place I used to be struggling usually
Look at the newer me fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans the stars everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'm a show you how to make it all work
Another plan it a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I set a plan it's a short term goal no sky is the limit
I'm past that now pass that
Award not one but four
Times two plus yours


I see myself performing there 
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better


You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps my heart my breath
Breathe hums? of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here


And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right lyrics

Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home will you tell the truth


Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you everyday collect calls
Never get through and I go through with drawls
Say who told you that I wanted this the
I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out yea every record shows
Commissary running low I need help
Not too much I hustle up the rest myself
K Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me then you know how bad I feel
Wish you prove me wrong and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left in the dark blind
Mama kiss the back of me this last time


Men lie Women lie
Men lie Women lie
Men lie Women lie
Men lie Women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home will you tell the truth


Mama take this motherfucking block off
Thats the date the state will take the blocks off
Pulled up and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me This ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
Remember when you put me in that relay run
I was racing chasing dreams to be the best
You had told me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me some support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal or take a loss
I ain't built for all them god damn numbers
God's will say a prayer for me mama
If you can't then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time




Now I tell if I stress take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself your own crutch
Look at your reflection tell me who you see
Who is your protection G-O-D
No its not neglection I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
Remember all the nights that I cried
Thinking that my only son just died
Peeking through the window Kicking through the door
It's you they looking for Raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son lyrics

Greetings boys and girls

My name is Petey P. 

Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (that's right that's right that's right)
I am your neighbor 
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid m.A.A.d city (good kid m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal 
Your pop guns  and fireworks and sing along


When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Sing along kids sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane blow it like Coltrane yeah

(Kendrick you remember that one time when we was...)

I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
we was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers to move
With nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansion
Gold ballroom AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies
Hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table of Sizzlers
But never made that visit if better days was on its way
Then it made the decision to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
(Oh yeah I remember that it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it right?)


When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million 
Spend it all in front of the county building 
Blow it like Coltrane blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget to sing along by the way sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane blow it like Coltrane yeah

And all the ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up when we grow up



Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety 
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty-
seven do the math ' 92 don't you be lazy 
Looking out the window notice all the essentials
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss
you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away probably had credentials
of a scholar but shit not today
them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators barbecue pits and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi I want them ten woo-woofers
Say that you got me if not I'll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bull's eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said lil nigga today the poor is rich
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
Bitches ain't shit hoes ain't neither
Niggas gon' snitch watch the company you keeping
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots



When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million 
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget still sing along kids still sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million 
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Playas always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table my nigga get you a table my nigga...


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank


No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up turn up til you throw up
Like a bulemic fiending for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city yo where the store at?
One bottle two bottles I'm a soldier never sober
Cup runneth over don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life that's all we have OK lets toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor swim laps like Michael Phelps


Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it




Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken
You with it?  Spread your wings you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us






So it's that groovy little nigga known for popping them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dick bitch everything about me solid
Burberry nigga them be my draws Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged-out king yeah nigga I'm Puff uh have that pussy throbbin'
Someone tell me where the drugs at I'm into that twisted off them molly caps
Ciroc too don't fuck wit Goose; can I get a shot swim in your juice?
Worth a stack a minute everyday that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet - bitch did you see your tab reciept?





Sherane?
(Pool full of liqour then you dive in in in in )
Sherane Sherane Sherane 

Sherane (Girls wanna play play play)
Where is she taking me? 
Where is she taking me


All I all I all I all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane; tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up; never ever wake up never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough


More more bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down more
Bottoms up then we pass it round more
Fill it up more not enough moooore
...Bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down more
Bottoms up then we pass it round more
Fill it up more not enough lyrics

Fuck Black hippy nigga I invented the recipe

It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess
Pretty Chick let me see them breast E.T. OG from the weed clinic 
Solo but I'm never alone  I stay high and I'm powerful 
Westside  I got three eyes man I see y'all
All I do is kill shit ICU party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off and they top off I'm getting topped off Top Dawg
Women weed and weather what more can I say to live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach - I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls


Every morning nigga I get blazed ; women weed and weather nigga if you bored 
Come and join the wave ; girl what is your name 
Cause I'm feeling your frame can I see what you bout ; a little something in your rear
Little something in your mouth little something on your couch ; know now what I'm talkin' about bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it I done drilled it she said she like it from the back like a real bitch 
She swallowed my pride I damn near cried
Yo I can't reply she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind


You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami party in New York
Texas I be screwed up Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown Im forever living
Women weed and weather  women weed and weather
For the women weed and weather  women weed and weather
Got that women weed and weather - don't it sound clever come and play
Wh-What more can I say? Welcome to LA


My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three day run
Bitch take them motherfuckin' panties off you ain't no nun 
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe I control California living 'til I am old
You want to be one to peak on the chart so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga ride with a nigga let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no uh uh if Im wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one to peak on the chart so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women weed weather its not my fault then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off




Jay Rock got the recipe fly hoes wanna roll I guess 
Everybody know I got that yola ask  she'll confess
I wake up then I bake up with a bad bitch she ain't got on  
Medicated please my nigga no telling where the high gonna take us uh
Three w's I'm at the W she got double D's bout to bring trouble through
OG Hennessy get their panties wet I'm trying to dive in the 
Left stroke right stroke whats the best stroke that stroke can smoke all down her throat
And we blows all kinds of dro Cali got the best so act like you know lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









When the four corners of this cocoon collide
Youll slip through the cracks hoping that youll survive
Gather your wind take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly


At first I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned all across the board
Destroyed but what for?

When I get signed homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up two times deuce four
Platinum on everything platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check like that


We should never gave we should never gave
Niggas money go back home money go back home




Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule a piano a guitar?
Anything see my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind 
Don't have receipts (Oh man that's fine)
Pay me later wear those gators
Cliche and say fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes two chains two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House do you
But remember you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five


Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top 
A lot of metaphors lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Fuck you motherfucker you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big nigga you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth nigga you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian wavy twenty eight inch you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway I need a baller ass boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga everybody know it your homies know it everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you nigga don't call me no more
You won't know you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on you off
What the fuck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free I mean baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims five percent tint and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin' naw this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit matador matador had the door knockin' let 'em in who's that?
Genital's best friend this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate like myself
Every dog has it's day now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension more pension you're pinchin' my consensus
Been relentless fuck forgiveness fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources all distortion if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted doomed disgusted forced with
Fuck you think is bullshit porcelain pipes pressure bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America you bad bitch lyrics

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
(Aye aye nigga what's happenin' nigga K Dot back in the hood nigga)
I'm mad  but I ain't stressin'
True friends one question

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him  Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams 
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping but a rapper with a ghost writer
What the fuck happened?
 I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell

Something's in the water 
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him  Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams 
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say...

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him  Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

You goat mouth mammy fucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city everybody's screamin' 
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo
Ah yeah fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' 
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king

Bitch where was you when I was walkin'-

(By the time you hear the next pop the funk shall be within you)

Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him  Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' 
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

(Funk funk funk funk funk funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk you gon' take it)
We want the funk

We want the funk

We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk you gon' take it)
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted lyrics

What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized I could still kill me a nigga so what?


If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me

Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo somethin' for somethin' that's the obvious
Oh shit flow's so sick don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be true but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me


Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now slow down


And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin' money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports presidential glass floor
Gold bottles gold models sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks suck a dick fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him quickly because he got it
It's the recession then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor meet my .44
When I see 'em put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...




And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you goodnight lyrics

I remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same

If these walls could talk 


Sex she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you if you if you exercise your right to work it out
Its true its true its true shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no


If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when Im in it I love it when Im in it

If these walls could talk theyd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket Im not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? Im just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable exclamation
Interior pink color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldnt stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when Im here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush



If these walls could talk theyd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down thats my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I dont know how long I can wait in these walls
Ive been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ I mustve missed them
Im not involved Id rather diss them
Id rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon crush



If your walls could talk theyd tell you its too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you you're reputable lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Loving you is complicated

I place blame on you still
Place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame him for?
Nigga I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside just a teenager where your patience?
Where was your antennas where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you you're fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you forever despise you I don't need you
The world don't need you don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too fuck your pride too that's for dedication
Thought money would change you made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you I hope you embrace it


Loving you is complicated

Lovin' you lovin' you not lovin' you one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin' recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes I hate you too

House keeping

House keeping
Abre la puerta! Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto
!Disculpe!

And you the reason why mama and them leavin'
No you ain't shit you say you love them I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible selfish in denial can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden everyone felt it
Everyone heard it multiple shots corners cryin' out
You was deserted where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother you ain't no disciple you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Little brother you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road bottles and bitches
You FaceTime'd the one time that's unforgiven
You even FaceTime'd instead of a hospital visit
'Cause you thought he would recover well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died God himself will say 
You ain't try

I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speaking nigga
Y'all damn near beefin' I seen it and you're the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk  I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you  I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up but ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Alls my life I has to fight nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like yah
Bad trips like 
Nazareth I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright


Nigga we gon' be alright
Nigga we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga we gon' be alright
Do you hear me do you feel me? We gon' be alright

Uh and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me reapin' everything I sow
So my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say


When you know we been hurt been down before nigga
When our pride was low lookin' at the world like "where do we go nigga?"
And we hate Popo wanna kill us dead in the street for sure nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright



What you want you a house you a car
40 acres and a mule a piano a guitar
Anything see my name is Lucy I'm your dog
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I can see the evil I can tell it I know it's illegal
I don't think about it I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it be about it everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it Heaven I can reach you
Pet dog pet dog pet dog my dog that's all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap I'm black on track so rest assured
My rights my wrongs I write till I'm right with God





I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








What's wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible too


My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I 
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I 
I want you more than you know

I remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I 
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I 



You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
I said oh no not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said this to me
I remember what you said too you said
My name is Lucy Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I dont do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy Give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it Lucy not timid Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if thats possible



I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence lyrics

Oh shit!
Oh I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
That sloppy

This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black  ball cap
(West west west)
We don't share the same synonym fall back
(West west west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home


We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I know everything I know myself
I know morality spirituality good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything I know Compton
I know street shit I know shit that's conscious I know everything
I know lawyers advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom I know bad religion I know good karma
I know everything I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything I know cars clothes hoes and money
I know loyalty I know respect I know those that's Ornery
I know everything the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded well that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids dont gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work I know the price of life
I know how much its worth I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didnt know shit
The day I came home



I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5 TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist I'll back off go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home

This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere

I been lookin for you my whole life an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe where you reside?
Is it in a woman is it in money or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind AH!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
)
(Jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
)
I been lookin for you my whole life an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe where you reside?
Is it in a woman is it in money or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind AH!
I say where you at from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react only when you react
Ah I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid ha lyrics

K dot pick up the phone nigga. Every time I call it's going to voice mail.
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit nigga.
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone


I been A-1 since day one you niggas boo boo
Your home boy your block that you're from boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch boo boo
We was in the hood 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap my nigga
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout your shit is where its at my nigga
Came in this game you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game your hood your name in this game
Now you double up time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up
Skip hop trip drop flip flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks burn this"
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute out the Compton zoo with the extras
El Cos Monte Carlos Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz P-Funkers Mexicans they fuck with you
Asians they fuck with you nobody can fuck with you



Hopped out the caddy just got my dick sucked
The little homies called they said 
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh yeah? Everythin' is everythin' it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin' scramblin' football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper you snitched all summer
The streets dont fail me now they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress its set trippin all around
Aint nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state which one you governin?
They give us guns and drugs call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you Obama say 



Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin
Motherfucker if you did then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Yall priorities are fucked up put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic my memory been gone since
Dont ask about no camera back at award shows
No dont ask about my bitch no dont ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power yeah I got a lot of it
Im the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
K. Dot what up? I heard they opened up Pandoras box
I box em all in by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive lyrics

How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling y'all
Gotta see how Im chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump 6 dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6 he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for 10 Rand  stressin' about dry land
Deep water powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice I didn't believe it
Told him 
Contributin' money just for his pipe I couldn't see it
He said "My son temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost


It's more to feed your mind
Water sun and love the one you love
All you need the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin' he's starin' at me I grab my key
He's starin' at me I started the car then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin' back at him feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost



Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement I know when nigga's hustlin' keep in mind
When I was strugglin' I did compromise now I comprehend
I smell grandpa's old medicine reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin nigga you're babblin' your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said 
I looked at him and said 
He looked at me and said "Know the truth it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah the son of Jehovah the higher power
The choir that spoke the word the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven embrace your loss I am God"


I wash my hands I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page help me change lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Complexion 
Complexion don't mean a thing 
Complexion 
It all feels the same 

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion I know what the Germans done
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window Im a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin' cover your ears he 'bout to mention



Dark as the midnight hour I'm bright as the mornin' Sun
Brown skinned but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak 
Sneak me through the back window Im a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin' I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind if he lyin' color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me "You're womanless woman love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...



You like it I love it
You like it I love it


Let me talk my Stu Scott scuse me on my 2pac
Keep your head up when did you stop? Love and die
Color of your skin color of your eyes
Thats the real blues baby like you met Jays baby
You blew me away you think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my Solomon up north 12 years a slave
12 years of age thinkin my shade too dark
I love myself I no longer need Cupid
And forcin my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light dont mean you smart bein dark dont make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas aint talkin Woohah!
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties L-L you lose two times
If you dont see you beautiful in your complexion
It aint complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite thats the context
Yeah baby Im conscious aint no contest
If you like it I love it all your earth tones been blessed
Aint no stress jigga boos wanna be
I aint talkin Jay I aint talkin Bey
Im talkin days we got school watchin movie screens
And spike yourself esteem
The new James Bond gon be black as me
Black as brown hazelnut cinnamon black tea
And its all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team blues and pirus no colors aint a thing

Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that dont play fair should I get out the car?
I dont see Compton I see something much worse
The land of the landmines lyrics

Everything black I don't want black
I want everything black I ain't need black
Some white some black I ain't mean black
I want everything black


Six in the mornin' fire in the street
Burn baby burn that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie you made me
Black don't crack my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16 came to my senses
You never liked us anyway fuck your friendship I meant it
I'm African-American I'm African
I'm black as the moon heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community makin' a killin'
You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga


The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry the bigger I shoot


I said they treat me like a slave cah' me black
Woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain cah' we black
Imagine now big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah' we black
Remember this every race start from the black just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up fill up my tank then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups show you what these big wheels 'bout ah
Black and successful this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga





I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me it's generational hatred
It's genocism it's grimy little justification
I'm African-American I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you  no fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets I know you hate me don't you?
You hate my people I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State 
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon chicken lyrics

Study long study wrong nigga
Hey y'all close that front door ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand actin' a fool
Hey hey babe check it out Imma tell you what my mama had said she like:

I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name


Askin'  to impress me
Askin'  to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head homie
Askin'  to impress me
Askin'  to impress me
Askin'  only upsets me
You sound like the feds homie


You ain't gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You ain't gotta lie you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy  emotional 
Self-pity  under oath 
The loudest one in the room nigga that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context





What do you got to offer?
Tell me before you we off ya put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin' been aversion to bullshit
Instead of dreamin' the auction tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazie bitches be fugazie
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him to her or that to them
Or you the truth you love to bend
In the back in the bed on the floor that's your ho
On the couch in the mouth I'll be out really though
So loud rich niggas got low money
And loud lyrics

Is this mic on? (Hey move this way this way)
Hey Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up c'mon c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls come up here
(One two one two what's happening fool?)
Come right here this is for you come on up
Kendrick Lamar make some noise brother

I done been through a whole lot
Trial tribulation but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And 
When you lookin' at me tell me what do you see?

Ahh I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

Illuminated by the hand of God boy don't seem shy

One day at a time uhh

They wanna say it's a war outside bomb in the street
Gun in the hood mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation 
I duck these cold faces post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile

And 
When you lookin' at me tell me what do you see?

Ahh I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

Illuminated by the hand of God boy don't seem shy

One day at a time uhh



Lift up your head and keep moving  turn the mic up

Peace to fashion police I wear my heart
On my sleeve let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this nigga

And 
When you lookin' at me tell me what do you see?

Ahh I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

Illuminated by the hand of God boy don't seem shy

One day at a time uhh

Huh  huh 
Huh (Down down valley deep) huh (Down down valley deep)
 huh  huh 
 huh  one two three

And 
When you lookin' at me tell me what do you see?

Ahh I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

Illuminated by the hand of God boy don't seem shy

One day at a time uhh

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night night night night night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message
I could never take the lead I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building lay my body...


Not on my time Not while I'm up here
Not on my time kill the music
Not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit this for the kids bro
2015 niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic- TuTu how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan how many we done lost?
No for real answer the question how many niggas we done lost bro?
This this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time you know that the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left dawg
On the dead homies. Charlie P you know that bro
You know that
It's mando. Right it's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac- enough said enough said
We gon' get back to the show and move on because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check mic check mic check mic check mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen
Listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase 
He said "Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'm a dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; King royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor King ruler now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'm a break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar by far lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two one two)
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone say

When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga

I been wrote off before I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all family friends fans cats dogs
Trees plants grass how the wind blow
Murphy's Law generation X will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step mauled by the mouth of
Pit bulls put me under stress
Crawled under rocks ducking y'all it's respect
But then tomorrow put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther JFK shoot or you assassin
Is it Jackie is it Jesse oh I know it's Michael Jackson oh

When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us  you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga


"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know I'm no mortal man maybe I'm just another nigga"

Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it
Another Nigga but it ain't really a poem I just felt like it's
something you probably could relate to. Other than that now that I
finally got a chance to holla at you I always wanted to ask you about a
certain situa-- about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground.
What you mean 'bout that what the ground represent?


The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil


Right


That's how I see it my word is bond. I see - and
the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna
open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich
people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what I'm
saying wealthy appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry you
know what I'm saying it's gonna be like there might be some cannibalism
out this mutha they might eat the rich


Aight
so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody that's
rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?


I
see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of
the word. I took nothin' I took the opportunities I worked at the most
menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where
I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the
person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized
my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made
myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time
to make millions for myself you know what I'm saying. I made millions
for the record companies I made millions for these movie companies now
I make millions for us


And through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?


By
my faith in God by my faith in the game and by my faith in "all good
things come to those that stay true." You know what I'm saying and it
was happening to me for a reason you know what I'm saying I was
noticing shit I was
punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem you
know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna
go straight through


Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?


Shit
I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened
with resistance it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it
goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying it's in my veins to
fight back


Aight well how long you think it
take before niggas be like we fighting a war I'm fighting a war I
can't win and I wanna lay it all down


In this country a
black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and
that's right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while
you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back. Cause
once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man
out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more.
And if you don't believe me you can look around you don't see no loud
mouth 30-year old muthafuckas


That's crazy
because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I
can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted
to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?


I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be like uh bloodshed for real. I don't think America
know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be
some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be
murder you know what I'm saying it's gonna be like Nat Turner 1831
up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying it's gonna happen


That's
crazy man. In my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music
and vibrations lotta people don't understand how important it is.
Sometimes I be like get behind a mic and I don't know what type of
energy I'mma push out or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes


Because the spirits we ain't even really rappin' we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us


Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:

"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar
But
having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as
weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different lyrics

Come here girl
Oh you want me to touch you right there?
Oh like a little lamb play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory life is
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying moving in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking swallowing young woman
With a baby daisies and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track mothers yelling hes alive
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom college classrooms been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
 no more running from world wars
 no more discriminating the poor
 no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four then I heard
What have you did for me
I fell to my knees pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didnt try for you say I didnt ride for you
I tithed for you I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix tell me you can fix
Anytime I need Imma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie I can see our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man child woman life completely went in reverse
I guess Im running in place trying to make it to church

Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go young nigga go
Young nigga go lyrics

Cornrow Kenny he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits
Parallel park like an alien cant visit
Slideshow for the night show ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold King Kendrick

So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence yeah we juggin like that
Act of violence yeah we juggin like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me hoping I dont relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought Id seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me Im about to let my hair down on hoes
Top billing thats a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas level two Im not done
2Teez told me that I am the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee thats something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Waters like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck Im as real as they come
Shit is amazing Im feeding my cravings
You know that you want me come here now lil baby
Im fuckin Im crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty come get to know us


Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep all day Mortal Man and Kunta
Alright lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









So I met this young lady ya know when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her you know give her my best cap but she kept on snapping her fingers like snaps. I said You know what girl? You crazy. Then she asked me what he said



A peace of mind
Thats what the Asian said I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing he said taking my time
Meditation is a must it dont hurt if you try
See you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career you ever think of your health?

A piece of land
Thats what the Indian said I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best really you should invest
These tangible things expire dont you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage we blessed

A piece of pussy
Thats what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said nigga come back to reality for a week
Pussy is power fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldnt be prouder you should allow it

A piece of mines
Thats what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it dont even matter
You make a million or more you living better than average
You losing your core following gaining it all
He put a price on my talent I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
Imma make you some promises that you just cant ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
If I dont target your market
If you aint signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your masters mortgage I need a piece


I holler What you do? What you say?
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler What you do? What you say?
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

What the black man say?
Tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die we multiply
Tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die we multiply
Tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die we multiply
Tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
Tell em we dont die lyrics

They say the government mislead the youth youth youth youth

And welfare dont mean well for you you you you

They tell me that my bills past due due due due

And preacher man dont always tell the truth truth truth
(Do you believe in God? If you dont its cool)


 head is the answer head is the future
Dont second guess yourself

Come on give me some help yeah
Head is the answer head is the future
Dont second guess yourself
Come on lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know


I got 100 on my dash got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular Im drunk
How can I can make them popular pop em when I want
See Im livin with anxiety duckin the sobriety
Fuckin up the system I aint fuckin with society
Justice aint free therefore justice aint me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now Im thinkin to myself hollow tips is all I got
Now Im drinkin by myself at the intersection parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin door and blowin out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine then sped off in the rain
Im gone


Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me


Drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin the handle
Lit off henny Im tryna dismantle
These wicked ways Ive engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel wait
Thats a bit ambitious maybe Im trippin
Maybe Im crazy maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
Its such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still dont recognize my flaws
I guess Im lost the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me Im tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key so I am king


The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton they tell me that Im blind
I know that Im intelligence my confidence just died
Carpe diem seize the day I cant compromise
A tape worm couldnt cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets they seein me as I pacify
But couldnt fathom the meaning of seein sacrifice
Im passin lives on a daily maybe Im losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why Im awake
Im sleep walkin Im street stalkin Im outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini duality personalities always conflict in me


Oh! But dont be scared of me girl
I can explain
I know its foreign to you
I know its hard to believe
God give me the favor
Let me explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance let me show you how
I can explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
Ill be there with the answer
Let me explain


Im bizarre avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
Its attractive
Youre intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings baby
Let me explain
I can explain it
Why dont you sit and talk to me?
I can explain
Let me explain it ah yeah
Let me explain


My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby no Im not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets covers and pillows
Im promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
Im promising that Im acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No youre not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And thats alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully Im invited hopefully you dont change
Because I know for sure who you are


I can explain
Your mama raised you your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school three miles away
To feed him knowledge
I can explain
Dont you explain that dont you explain the reason why your mind it travels
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But dont you ever
Let me explain
Oh shando!
I spin around two times lyrics

Young Egypt
Look look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather Im charged
Our father who art in Heaven Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin the odds
What an accomplishment broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like yall fear God
You sound frantic I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin your bars
Before you poke out your chest loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital avenues lookin like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin my stock rise
The salary the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags look at my photo
Black excellence pessimist died countin my coin
Hope its evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecasted my future this is the future
The mastermind until my next album more power to you
Gunshots



Come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on

This is a fifteen minute song
Were just jammin out we on stage
Taz we just jammin out
Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand you gotta see it!
Look look look go back to the down note
They all sing this shit everybody

Now I dont let you down and for
You see you see you see you see
But I dont shake you down dog for you you you you
They say the government aint the truth truth truth truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth youth youth youth

But head is the answer
Head is the future
Dont second guess yourself
Come on give me some help
Hey one more time band I need yall to help me out right now
Head is the answer
Head is the future its the future that nigga said
Dont second guess yourself
Come on give me some help
Say come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on my background singer
Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on

I said girl you make me wanna uh

You make me wanna just AHHH!
Baby you got me speechless right now

Said you just make me wanna Drake you down
To the ground to the ground ground
Like bam bam bam bam bam
You just make me wanna Drake you down
Down around like bam bam bam bam bam
And baby if your mamas around if your mamas around
If your mamas around if your mamas around
Tell her tell her

And she can get this dick too!

I said come on come on come on come on come on come on

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Im down on my luck
And its something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money and its breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnt hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success Corvettes by tomorrow


Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Im down on my luck
And its something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money and its breaking me down honey

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she dont give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you woman I console you woman
You feel like the universe owes you woman
Oh the anticipation of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four plus more
If yan't get it right tell me do you got the stamina?
But shit ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them


Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Im down on my luck
And its something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money and its breaking me down honey

I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell "Kendrick American they sho is crazy"
And I said why?
Then he looked me in the eye and said 
Youre banking on good luck you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit youre crying hysterical
You settle for everything complain about everything
You say you sold crack my world amphetamine
Your projects aint shit I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm you living to pay rent
I paid my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that youre looking for dope
These days aint no compromise
And your pain aint mines half the time
A brand new excuse aint shit to me
Bitch I made my moves with shackled feet
Cape Town

In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them him and her
But when a blessing takes too long that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker


Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Im down on my luck
And its something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?


So I was takin' a walk the other day and I seen a woman-a blind woman-pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while I decide to go over and lend a helping hand you know? "Hello ma'am can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it.Oh yes you have lost something. You've lost... your life."




Is it wickedness?

Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song quote: "And we hate the popo wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'..."
Oh please ugh lyrics

I got I got I got I got
Loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power poison pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate I meditate then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got I got I got I got
Realness I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again then win again like Wimbledon I serve
Yeah that's him again the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work I know just who you are
See you's a you's a you's a-
Bitch your hormones probably switch inside your DNA
Problem is all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy probably snitched heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist born outside a jellyfish I gauge
See my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through probably offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder conviction
Burners boosters burglars ballers dead redemption
Scholars fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah yeah yeah yeah soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9 on-sale motel we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29 I've done so well hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth when the prophet say

I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life I'm rollin' several dice fuck your life
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better fuck your life
5 4 3 2 1
This is my heritage all I'm inheritin'
Money and power the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin' marble on the floors
Beach inside the window peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on I don't conversate
I don't compromise I just penetrate
Sex money murder-these are the breaks
These are the times level number 9
Look up in the sky 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate gonna be our faith
Peace to the world let it rotate
Sex money murder-our DNA

Gimme some ganja gimme some ganja

I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close-get money fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic I checked the signal that read-

Buzzin' radars is buzzin'

Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: 
Yeah that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know he walks the Earth
But it's money to get bitches to hit yah
Zeroes to flip temptation is yah
First on my list I can't resist yah
Everyone together now know that we forever-

Y'all know what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go

I don't give a I don't give a I don't give a fuck

I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D.O.T. my enemy won't catch a vibe for this shit ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me I'm on your head ayy
30 millions later know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my telegram like 
I be hangin' out at Tam's I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke family sellin' dope
That's why you maney ass rap niggas better know

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga I'mma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up hop out air out made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah take me out my element

I'm allergic to a bitch nigga ayy
An imaginary rich nigga ayy
Seven figures ho that's slimmer than my bitch figure ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls ayy
We okay we let the A1 fly
Relocate jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah I go yeah
They never been ready yeah I know yeah I know yeah

None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah the flow yeah
Years in the makin' and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide we talkin' 'bout races
You know this'll never be a tie just look at their laces
You know careers take off just gotta be patient
Mister one through five that's the only logic
Fake my death go to Cuba that's the only option

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga I'mma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up hop out air out made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah take me out my element

Damned if I do if I don't ya
Goddamn us all if you won't ya
Damn damn damn it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline get out the goddamn way

Niggas thought they weren't gonna see me huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life was the same life they see on TV huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in LA for free huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway we need receipt huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all go squeal
Most of y'all just envy but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes
Most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade
Most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artist
But it's a difference 'tween black artist and wack artist


If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga I'mma make it look sexy


It's the one and only the world's greatest the Kid Capri


If I gotta go hard on a bitch I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up hop out air out made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah lyrics

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me

I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow fuck the world
The world is endin' I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself no feelings involved
I feel for you I've been in the field for you
It's real for you right? Shit I feel like-

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debating on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'mma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin' the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look I feel like I can't breathe
Look I feel like I can't sleep
Look I feel heartless often off this
Feelin' of fallin' of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin' fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters false prophets schemin'
Sponsors industry promises
Niggas bitches honkies crackers Compton
Church religion token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings I mean this for imposters
I can feel it the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin' I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up (high high high)
Girl you look so good it's to die for 
Ooh that pussy good it's to die for 


It's a secret society
All we ask is trust

All we got is us
Loyalty loyalty loyalty
Loyalty loyalty loyalty


Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time right now



Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve swerve swerve swerve deeper now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas I'm a natural I'm alright


I'm a savage I'm a asshole I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah shimmy-yeah shimmy-yeah rock 
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside 
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honesty forever all a real nigga want


I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up 


(All I want is all I want is)
Loyalty loyalty loyalty
Loyalty loyalty loyalty


(10-4 no switchin' sides)
Feel somethin' wrong
(You actin' shifty you don't ride)
With me no more I need
Loyalty loyalty loyalty
Loyalty loyalty loyalty


Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin' only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart


Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? 
Do it end with your family and friends? 
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said tell me who you loyal to


Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?


That's what God for


I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired fire)
All I want tonight is just get high up


(All I want is all I want is)
Loyalty loyalty loyalty
Loyalty loyalty loyalty


10-4 no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty you don't ride
With me no more I need
Loyalty loyalty loyalty
Loyalty loyalty loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin' lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and-


Me I wasn't taught to share but care
(In another life I surely was there)
Me I wasn't taught to share but care
(I care I care)


Hell-raising wheel-chasing new worldy possessions
Flesh-making spirit-breaking which one would you lessen?
The better part the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See in the perfect world I would be perfect world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure


Me I wasn't taught to share but care
In another life I surely was there
Me I wasn't taught to share but care
(I care I care)


Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there


Now in a perfect world I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what Winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition feel like we belong here
I know the walls they can listen I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See in a perfect world I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit but He's been perfect world


Me I wasn't taught to share but care
(In another life I surely was there)
Me I wasn't taught to share but care
(I care lyrics

 Wicked or weakness you gotta see this waaaaay (yeah yeah!)
 Nobody pray for me it been that day for me waaaaay (yeah yeah!)

Aye tastes like kool aid for the analysts
Girl I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good won't you sit it on my taste bloods
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block then break it down we playing Tetris
A.M. to the P.M. P.M. to the A.M. funk
Piss out your per diem you just gotta hate em funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
Soprano C we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it you and I know bitch be humble

Get the fuck off my stage I'm the sandman 
Get the fuck off my dick that ain't right

Show me something natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mamma's couch in polo socks aye
This shit way too crazy aye

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh I don't want more than that
Girl I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said 


Yeah I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'-

Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit no time for battles
Well I I never expected

This that new shit
This that new new shit


Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you-

Door in his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit no time for battles
Well I I never expected

Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy- hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean go get a pistol shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin' just make it count

Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
Hop in the shower put on your makeup lace your weave up
Touch on yourself call up your nigga tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam get you a Visa make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill call up your bitches have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club have you some fun make that ass bounce
It's whatever just make it count


I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down

Too close to comfort

She said 

I wake in the mornin' my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance feelings I did-what a fast life!
Manager called the lobby called it's 11: 30
Did this before promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry 100k I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried all of us buried and our feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal make us feel cheap
Still and sad distraught and mad tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin' things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs stuck in our ways; Lust

Lately I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately lately lately my lust been hidin' 
Lately it's all contradiction
Lately I'm not here
Lately I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately in James 4: 4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself lust is all yours

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh I don't want more than that
Girl I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in

Oh by the way open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way

Pick up the phone for me babe

Bad attitude from your nanny
Curves and your hips from your mammy
Remember Gardena I took the studio camera

Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way

If I minimized my net worth would you still ?

Can you help me underst-
 New Kung Fu Kenny


Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin' whoa
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like "Bitch I did that!"
X-rated

Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo' no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' 
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America you know we all love him

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin' he was mobbin' way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual my spirit do no better but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected moments you could never touch

I'll wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like "Bitch I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister touch my woman
Touch my daddy touch my niece
Touch my nephew touch my brother

You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back-

Alright kids we're gonna talk about gun control
 Damn!


It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around


Hail Mary Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street your street back streets
Wall Street corporate offices
Banks employees and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in you Crippin' or you married to blood?
I'll ask again-oops-accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
America's reflections of me lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
What's up family? Yeah it's yo cousin Carl man just givin' you a call man. I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately and I know you feel like you know people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this man that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28: 28 says "The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart." See family that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo you will always feel that way...


Why God why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more won't you burn this muh'fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth


I beat yo ass keep talkin' back
I beat yo ass who bought you that?
You stole it I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside I beat yo ass lil nigga
That homework better be finished I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass you know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now I'm high now
I'm high now I'm high now
Life's a bitch pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now I'm high now
I'm high now I'm high now
Life's a bitch pull them panties to the side now
Now...

When I was 27 I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27 my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin' drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself my family my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear whatever it is both is distinctive
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap


Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all


Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments until you come back to these commandments we're gonna feel this way we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us the so-called Blacks Hispanics and Native American Indians are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel he's gonna punish us for our iniquities for our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son so the Lord thy God chasten thee. So just like you chasten your own son he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws statutes and commandments and do what the Lord said these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today in the United States of America. I love you son and I pray for you. God bless you lyrics

Huh yeah (a-ha-ha a-ha-ha)

Ever since a young man
All I wanted to be was a gunman
Shootin' up the charts better run man
Y'all gotta see that I won man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves work it JT
Handle bars like a fade watch me work it JT
I'm at large runnin' plays like a circuit JT
I'm sellin' verses JT watch me work it JT
Look look hol' up!
Don't judge me my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me I was young fuckin' all the rats
Don't judge me aimin' at your head for a stack
Dont judge! Don't judge me!
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me won't you tell a friend y'all gon' see

Fuck is you talkin' to?
Aye do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all done it all felt pain more
For the cause I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

I don't rush shit fuck shit
Always your shit my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitate duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich my heart is famous

This what God feel like
Huh yeah 
Laughin' to the bank like 

Huh yeah 
Flex on swole like 

Huh yeah 
You feel some type of way then a-ha! 

Huh lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why why why why?
Why why why why?
Just remember what happens on Earth stays on Earth
We gon' put it in reverse


Darling I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you sweetheart
That my...


Oh Lamar Hail Mary and marijuana times is hard
Pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
I might be buggin' infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children listen it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler graduated to a brick on him
10000 dollars out of a project housing that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin' Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window his name was Ducky
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects Chiraq the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us crime intelligent felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them same strangers you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight


So lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










Said I'm a fuckin monster a massive attack'll haunt ya
I mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometers
Popped 'em all as they popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back! They promised us no pajamas insomnia
will attack I attack like pirahna does
Hit your block like a comet BLAP
And you all know what time it is 20-12 mark your calendars
Calisthenics and silencers exercisin that trigger STRIP!!
Rock with us Metallica competition no talent
Hum in the jungle what's wild enough?
Just might stumble upon a PACK of lions
No lyin my soilders dyin this is I-RAQ
Alliances linin with stars and bars of a prison WRECK
My science applyin pressure her strecher is needed
pay the proceeds or you live in DEBT!
Y'all soft as a giga-pet; you niggaz can't see me
unless you watchin the TV or ultra huggin my SILHOUETTE
My flow got the ceiling WET; I spit 'til I feel my BREATH
go sink in my fuckin chest
She fuckin the fuckin best mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

Yo Dre! Me and Andre the Giant 6'7" and climbin
Whether you storm to your climate whether your beat makin or rhymin
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman handful of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island wit Ray Bans
Glasses palmin asses that probably came wit a great tan hee hee
I be the motherfuckin Mecca of these Hub City spectrum
Where they at? I will disect 'em like a fuckin frog's rectum
While you wreckin with a wreckin ball my words flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Et cetera et cetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin us about shit #HiiPoWer in your mouth bitch!
And top dog can vouch bitch; nigga what you 'bout?A
bout face wit army outfits the general's here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin pinacles of life and despair
And me I solemnly swear
to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin Allah for it!
Only difference is I be spazzin and still apply for it!
Put me in a category I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory yo' pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippin
Bitch I been doin before you niggaz ruined it show me somethin different
You either kissin dick or givin me distance
You live in a disrict of dimebags and dummys; I know your statistics
Who your boss he more like my assisstant?
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break-fast when we aimin them biscuits
Pay cash when ya chain come up missin Q!!!


 Double ups dude what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin  droppin soon they watchin
I just lock and load explode target flowed I'm somewhere blowed
Mary got some swishers sweets L.A. nigga prolly east
Cheerin for the ragin beats X-O Henny' scrape the keys
Bangin C I'm bangin B put them niggaz next to me
Stop and focus get the lead I'm hear now let the hardest be
Shit all them dudes got ovaries - PERIOD!
Run on sentence still I'm ventin air conditionin coolest breeze

I was learnin getting knowledge head is throbbin she a goblin
We be mobbin over bitches stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness pussy frenchin just a mission

Getting money drop a nigga
Rush a nigga stomp a nigga
Crush a nigga dust a nigga
Copperhead gon' crush a nigga heatin up the winter nigga
Somethin to remember nigga hella sick I got a spit
Cursed with a verse like God told me kill the shit
Load a clip hecklin cops the Hoover king!
Bada bing by the ding-a-ling natural Hoover
Fing' ring with a vision clearer than Visine Asiang from Beijing
Money make her cum she cream; feed the weak that's WingStop
At the start wit rain drops Autobots
Space shuttle shittin on your car lots - boy stop!
Could at least got excitin huh? #HiiPoWer you see our pattern huh?
Workin on tracks like we never been free
22 squezze niggaz shootin off C's please let a nigga bar 16's
Rhyme 16's lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says .
I got my hopes up again oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards darling.


And we'll be screaming out "No Rules No Rules"
Feel the energy we go through I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to I showed you
My vision of the unsocial is so cool
Look around me and just see the same who to blame?
See my generation has no shame I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future this is nothing that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim my religion is to move you
Out your power position my army head on collision
Cant harm me out of my own skin government need assistance
Every time that I zone in
Nothing is more convincing than telling you that I won't bend
Break or fake partition
I can't this is my life design
This is me taking mines this is what I live for
This is me taking yours this is more than c4
This is what happens when we're ready to build and destroy
I hope that you enjoy


It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says .
I got my hopes up again oh no... not again.
Feels like we only go backwards darling.


I live my life a rebel a vigilante Devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld undertakers won't catch me
System make no sense don't feel justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted don't you walk passed me
With the condescending look I can tell you're pretending
Like you my friends and you just a henchman I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it I come from a glove that breed a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aiming to go and get your democracy
This is me changing faces cuz I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory and fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise
I'm waiting for it
You can't ignore it you live dormant
I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell that you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason
Capisce


It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says .
I got my hopes up again lyrics

Man Beyonce I'm mad at you man


They say hello  hello 
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know they say hello  hello 
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
till I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

I remember you were sixteen on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes I was impressed
You was like 'No no no' I was like twelve years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you're on the road
You wore braids with a banging body
Looked like you did Pilates a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that I was there from the start
Even when LeToya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway you deserved to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle I'm just saying
They cool but you? You something like Wonder Woman
And I just want to hold your hand bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park we can build castles in the sand
Eating Hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished



I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
I gazed at the cover for a whole five minutes till my girlfriend hit me
She's jealous of you B cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh-oh uh-oh oh-no-no" just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed I tell her we connect
like Ice Cube way before the Mack 10 feud
She like you goddamn fool that girl's rich and you're broke
I said so I'm five-hundred mill' away there's still hope
Anyway I had feelings way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for taking up for you
I would have stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay shoulda did that I thought he had your bizzack
What happened Mr. Izzo? Hopico with Frederico?
He used to be my favorite till he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on 'Ether'


They say hello  hello 
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know they say hello  hello 
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know hmm

I'ma sneak backstage at a Mary J. Blige concert
with an 'I Love Mary' shirt then find Jay-Z
and push him into a dancer hopefully they lock lips
That's when I yell out Sounwave hurry up take the pic
Put it on Bossip the same night yeah that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep they'd be sure to fight
Better yet I'ma steal his cell then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit
Like you don't the back of my knees right so this marriage is over with
And the ring that's on my finger guess what I'm throwing it 
You heard the sound so you know I did
Ha-hahhh that should get him
I should break 'em up like a Kit Kat when I do that yeah true that
I'ma put the plot in motion that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray this plan never worked

Yeeeea man I hope Jay don't be mad at me bout this song
Start- ay Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha what you say? Nah you think it'll be hot for real though?
Nigga you stupid"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe " lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics




"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe "





I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe


Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit so what
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic my nigga
This courtesy of Compton
Brooklyn go hard motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like 
Go get me a knife you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high I stake out for days
And when the water inside you're Bobby Boucher
We thirsty nigga never alert me nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me nigga this is a burpee nigga
Lyrical exercise
Right now homie I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down it occurred when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon that's excellent




Up in the clouds me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down can't hear myself think
Turbulence shit almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers all I do is ball
No I don't 'member you I don't intend to empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it baby Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hilary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon name one nigga out there harder than him I'll wait
I've been in my weight like 20 years straight
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight
Don't fuck up my high don't fuck up my high
Nights like this I could fuck up a pie
Still keep straight and still be straight
Fall back bitch I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest the highest title numero uno
Kill my vibe that's your motherfuckin' funeral


Between you and me turn eulogy to urinals niggas pissed off
I'm in this lil' diss shit I'm pushin' my fart
Leader of the new school on my toes like a ballerina
Who knew I'd be Black Swan
World in my palms ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best
Cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16 that I'd write a 16
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with 16 should have been in the pen
But then my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas audio crack khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap was running for dear life but now I'm running the map
Bitch I'm here nigga
Picture little old me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga you'll never be Jay never be Nas never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or hit a Suburban
Nigga Puffy Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears I just aim at them on purpose
Like bluck Mini-14 like bluck
Empty out another magazine like bluck
Hit a young nigga get back
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe
I am the bad the good God lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Dick hard like Rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo woo woo

The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi I'm just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar the people's champion I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won't mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling gang-banging my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss em
What this about is it money or skill?
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts of it it's real
You see my oath is very unbreakable my style is never mistakable
I can see y'all incapable
To be the God emcees you know me well
Ridiculous venomous hate in my heart the sinister
Run for cover my lineage prove itself
I'm rollin' deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays that's how it played nowadays
It's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays my gun is off the waist nowadays
It's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays I'm talking
Hiiigher power every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths entire lion
Surround itself with bears watch it nigga you share a profit ah!
This is what they want I'm the one
This is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'
I'm the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I'm yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I'm in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout God-bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in I'm David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea let's go there my DNA is DMT I'm so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn't track me down in my career
Runnin' this shit with four pair son of my bitch I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya chico what have you done here?
D-Bo all of it one year Mississippi to California
It gets annoying niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him but industry shit ain't for him
Probably thinking it's for him only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom baby rappers abort them
To the grave I deport them corporations extort them
I'm snapping off my endorphins I alien mighty morphin'
My radiance rather gorgeous hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise pace myself it's important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing this fucking studio haunted 
I tell a bitch don't sweat me 
I kill this whole fuckin' beat if Cole let me 
Ib should've never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y'all gon' die here
Oh Lord gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on yeah
Hoochie coochie pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating salaries better ratings
And casualties all around me don't make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I'm sorry y'all not relating this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it gotta show you fuckers I'm not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










I wanna hit line drives
Wanna lose weight?
For you
Hey what's up doc?


Now I was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
You was holding the handgun she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me "Don't be like me just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it


And I run it yeah BLUH
Yes I run it BLUH BLUH BLUH BLUH
I run it BLUH BLUH BLUH BLUH
Yes I run it I run it
Yeah BLUH yeah


Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you motherfucker hope y'all amused

I run it BLUH BLUH BLUH BLUH
And I run it BLUH BLUH BLUH BLUH
Yeah Yeah BLUH
Yes I run it


This shit make a nigga just wanna ride
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks had nothing that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I'm a maniac when aiming at the enemy delight
Tell a story that I'll never flourish 25
Not to worry every warrior will come and see you fully
Young that's a covenant that I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody go tie your shoe
Nobody grew up by  your rule
Nobody horn your gun how come your tongue say killer then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Lit a whole leaf feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lighting bolt
Til' I wreck into a pole like a right to vote
I am from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain nigga take it from you
A new Dame one stripe and you a zebra look alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun
Do things we'll never learn soon
And the error where we wanna earn soon
That's an error you can smell it in the air
Everybody really doomed
That's why I backed on you motherfuckers
All ya'll can suck my dick
All them days that the county buildings
I"m bout to make my momma rich
Cartoons and 
I ain't felt this 
Scrooge McDuck 
Elementary hood shit






This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'm a aim sloppy at a loud mouth discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts niggas gone flip that car
AK's for the whole hood
House lit went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
Overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Darkwing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck she's nervous
Drama hauled in the clutch hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no drum machine
This block stay jerking the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everybody corner 
Get a toe tag when you play tac with a task of a new 
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it 
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since 
Cartoons and cereal




Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth just for you
Motherfucker hope y'all amused!
I did wrong karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends enemies all the same
State fed both can hang
Nobody can mute me but I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me no mic
No cameras no lights lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway a gas pedal and a peace of mind
Now thats the ultimate high
To the cloud I go cloud I go
One time baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go cloud I go
Two time baby tell me ya love me


Cause Ive been drinking too much thinking too much
We aint been keeping in touch
Fell into lust where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as you wanna be hands on my new garments
And luckily being in denial aint the case
Cause I know shes unfaithful
Instead Im grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know youre feelings hating
Fact you think Im ungrateful I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow




Cause I been dreaming too much thinking too much
We aint been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump give me that rush
Im gone like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more but I fiend for benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil and lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know selfish as I wanna be
And every time Im under you lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscing on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurting I could see it plenty tears no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug some of his brother blood got on me
Clenching his fists on some angry shit
Stood up sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hanging with
I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge what do say to a good friend
that just lost it and grabbing choppers out the closet?
I tried my best to make him renege but he was like my nig'
This feeling is more than personal
I stood down he hopped in a hour-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block he said K. Dot you wouldn't understand


These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me or war
(Or at least try to understand) the city pressure
The AK-47 twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me or war

Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement postcard read
rest in peace the yellow tape blocking off the streets
A baby momma yelling at the police
But you don't understand you figure that we're just a bunch of niggas
But the picture is a story untold
See this wasn't in our plans
Babies from the late eighties wasn't born crazy we was raised that way
Put that Malcolm X book down then raised that K
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
Look the Devil in the face from a saint eye
Cast a 'spell' on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
Substance time is no longer an issue
We don't have it so pass the tissue
Then close the casket kiss the momma when you can
Then tell her you understand but you don't understand


These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me or war
 the city pressure
The AK-47 twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me or war

He came back fifteen minutes later
He said Dot I went on one do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place let nobody see you
This is critical as it gets my nigga I need you
I said alright so what happened? Seen a few niggas slipping
and I just started clapping I didn't care who I was hitting
That's wild shit but anyway I got you
I love you my nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next morning with a cold
Allergies got me sneezing and wiping my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet looking for some DayQuil
But all I seem was some aspirins just my luck
I got up went to Rite Aid
Hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot that's when I seen the faces of death
Said they was looking for my man with a chopper in their hand
Praying that it would jam but you don't understand


These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me or war
(Now tell me do you understand?) the city pressure
The AK-47 twin MAC-11s 
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons 
Pray for me or war


It's like lyrics

Abba Zabba
You know we get in the studio and do what we do best you know?
Beautiful shit
But this time around I want to do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig'?
Hop on them keys real quick my nig'


Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
Yeah ha-ha-ha yeah
This shit my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like


Check me out she say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I want to close my eyes and feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap/rap around me and grab my hips
So enticing on point like the helmet of a viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I can get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she want to vent
Now she can talk about her boss and I can give advice
or she can take the panties off and I can eat the pie
Fuck that option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune you know why?


This shit that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like
Ha-ha-ha yeah
This shit my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Abba this shit my girlfriend will like my nigga


Look we be in the car bumping my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 P.M.
It's a club banger catchy hooks and 808s
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first eight bars she loving the track
Even rewinding it back soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like that's hot
till I start talking how many hoes I got
How many I've fucked how many I've misled
just to get a nut like a squirrel in pursuit of lunch uh
Though I'm on some cliche rapper shit
I know she thinking all my lyrics they're accurate
She so cool though
Don't downplay it just to fuck up the mood yo
She will still play it even though I sound rude yo
and disregards to them provocative records one thing that I do know


This something that my girlfriend will like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend will like
Ne-ma-ne-ma-ne-ma-nem 
Told you that my girlfriend would like...
... other hoes tonight
'Soul! (This shit my girlfriend will like too haha)
(Kendrick I got you)


This a great idea
This will be girlfriend joint right here
So I'ma kick the shit she like it seem right
like a pair of jeans that fit tight around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
at the movies her body-language gets read
like a ruby cause she a work of art
No help from Julie I'm a beast and she's such a beauty
I love her she know that I place no one above her
Far from a narc but best under cover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
like an iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me I mean me and her
I mean her and I it's plain to see affirmative
So if you ever need me you know where Herbert is
On her mind like she on mine uh
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like
cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too this shit my girlfriend would write
if she was me talking bout her lyrics

And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth yeah you know we...

Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac brown
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30 Telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies Well what do you know? I think they love us


And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good 
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood 
Represent the city like you know you should 
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on
 We got it going on

As I continue my day quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout hungry as hell
Had the right grub I bail need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on  and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes shoot something nigga break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat



So wherever you located won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up a rare jewel you duck
Take 'em to school I must this for the cool in us
This ain't for you lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Yea. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good.
Can I pay my past a visit?
So tell me your Compton school district
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
Kendrew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L wood got the white Toyotaand we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no barrels so if those chopper beam never really could shoot back
Could of lost our life for hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we lucky enough
That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
I know some nigga less fortunate was fucking with they enemies bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
size 5 Jordans Rolex ward and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well she's important well she wasn't she was just so and so
So and so cousin he was so red
So anytime she got into it that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask do ya got a man
She said no he said oh yeah
Where do you stay she said Rosecrans
Rosecrans and what? she said don't matter just know I Fuck
He said what? your a your a little freaky bitch huh?
She said yeah baby I can you get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you come
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk
And that he did that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house rubber on panties down oldies playing in the back ground
Lets get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go picked his place up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with
And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes them hoesthem hoes them hoes
Them hoes hoes them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes that have you uh dead dead dead
Look. I guess we can all learn from mistakes
But your first mistake might be your death date
And death doesn't wait on no one
A million ways to die and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasn't born it boys in the hood the movie let him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody he quit working but really he's worthless
His momma had money his daddy had money so he had money
The OG's had gave him a pistol today there's going to be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought was about it like Pnilla
But he wasn't no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did approached this guy lyrics

Ayy I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact I'm downin' this
D'USS with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M. P.M. to the A.M. funk
Piss out your per diem you just gotta hate 'em funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it you and I know

Bitch be humble (hol' up bitch)

Get the fuck off my stage I'm the Sandman 
Get the fuck off my dick that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy this shit way too crazy ayy you do not amaze me ayy

Watch my soul speak you let the meds talk ayy

September 22nd 2009
Kendrick Lamar to... to...

Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me thinking of when I'ma meet you
You introduced yourself to so many others mothers sisters and brothers
Children and babies drive me crazy I wonder
why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type?
One of my biggest fears
is waking up four in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that I'll never meet cause of you
You son of a bitch and I wish you never existed
And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you paid me a visit
But that's not realistic cause you'll never write
But I'ma still send this letter off P.O. Box
and when you get it


Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
because it's personal

Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
I'm scared of you but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring the sorrow and the hearts you break
Every day you remind me that you're always there
cause every time I come around someone's getting shot down
And all I say is a prayer so help me Lord
Then the Lord talk back I can't help you boy
That's fucked up my luck's fucked was cursed before birth
and what's fucked up I gotta live my life with the hurt
of knowing that you're everlasting dwelling upon the masses
of the earth fatal assassins snatch your bodies
Probably on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
Sooner or later I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
So when I write on this paper it's real talk so




Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too
and the reason why we haven't met because I've been busy dude
But ever since grade school I watched your every move
You slipped up a few times
I gave you a pass so don't say I ain't sympathetic
But you can bet it your curiosity I'ma dead it
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Let's just say I had a bad day
Matter of fact everyday gotta take it out on somebody
and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
I was born to be a killjoy I'm a old brat
conceived by Adam and Eve so who you mad at?
Not me see me I'm just doing my job
and you ducking me is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I'd rather knock on your door and just give it to you


It's everywhere the streets the corners
The coroners the morgues
Cemeteries hospitals
Heard about 'em when I was little
Tomorrow's not promised
Cause any day he can be knocking at your front door
War genocide homicide
Suicide all coincide
Signed and sealed by the living
Make it lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








I can tell you what it is I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name that's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this bidness
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
Weighing my options pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But this monkey on my back y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar will I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him hell no
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
Well I want the world tell me how long that takes
There's no time like now I can cut my patience/patients short
or give 'em some more gowns I don't even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind and nigga when I get it
you won't get a piece of mine won't you mind your own bidness?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well I'm a broke nigga
But still I wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a Bible quote nigga
Pfttuh

See I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops said for sure I'd listen
You said you did dirt but I can't dig it
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
Oh-no-oh-oh
I swear we got to fast-forward...

Before time flies by
My new sound for '0-10 is why lie?
And if you ain't trying to win then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
This is I nigga look into my eye
Nigga I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are pfttuh

And that used to be a hell of a task
Now I'm ahead of my class so go ahead and harass
my character like it don't carry a
confidence that can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
I'm bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass then tell you get lost
What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
Once the 'Eves' come they quick to stare 'Adam'/at him
Hoping I don't take they bitch but I'm on some other shit
When I'm done I'm tryna run the government
They are big dreams
Transition from a rapper to a human being you can't 'school' a dean
I be tutoring artist-es leave 'em with no audience
All cause they all oversaw it my God
Y'all be out partying I be stealing your audience
All because who I are Lamar

But my first name it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are lyrics

These streets is jurassic cowards get asthmatic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere that the ghetto burb
Pull up on the curb  smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate verbal assassin strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed no sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states beneath the speed
Can corral the largest crowds mosh pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle devour hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder
No challengers can compete they're childish and weak detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm kurupted!

I'm kurupted!

Gimme a hundred G's for every Emcee I drop to their knees
Verbically useless oh you got the Juice? I'll squeeze you juiceless
Catch you hang you from many nooses
Been the truth since Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless twenty-one with twenty-one guns shottys thats looted from pac lyrical cyclops
Lazer-in on paper and fraudulent friends bitch yous a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples I swear to god
Count your lyrics in a jar I'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin
Cannibal co-existing with the coldest that means I'm the sickest and Theraflu won't do
Whenever I'm kicking the wickedness explosive syntagmatic smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck
I'm kurupted!

I'm kurupted!

 I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it the little homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalanche swap-meet 
Blunt longer than Rose Grants I'll grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches you are counterfeit
Worthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg TDE CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A.S.A.P
Complete havoc compulsive disorder rhyme addict -- Slaughter
House is full of Joey Joells and Royces for ya'
Live from the area code of Three-One-Oh laughin' all the way to the bank with three Elmos
Three six-fo's One bottle of Goose I'm the truth you could put your hand on the bible and shoot

Uh yeah 
Kendrick Lamar uh

Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessy drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like when novocaine stabs
in your arteries pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California corners with coroners and karma on 'em
Colors corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crip and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime Bible nor the Qur'an can save
Welcome don't be afraid your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two at twenty I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
his momma and sister his older cousin he honored him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny he might have been a modern day rider then
he walking outside again he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
more gangster under the family tree took 'em under his  like KFC
Crip crazy rocking matching T-shirts that says 
No love just spread slugs that's the policy the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty doo-wop holding a oowop hanging with rah-rahs
with blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
Going on missions with lunatics a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months smoking like six blunts an hour
The power of banging he was walking from... 
Little Johnny


"I think you'll find sir that there will come a time
when black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
and this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you'll have a situation
where when you attack one black man you are attacking all black men
and this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end
to the brutality inflicted upon black people by 
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court lyrics

Wow I think y'all must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something


I'm like ha-ha-ha-ha-hah L-M-A-O
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah L-M-A-O
Laughing at haters in here
I be her favorite in here
She want to play-play
What more can I say-say?

But mm jumped in the coupe and I'm gone
I smell like money I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak that can jump on the bone
Like an X-ray technician my rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs all cause I'm twenty-one
Like playing blackjack picture this Kodak
Moment forever K. Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite I'm that cool


I got a pocket full of checks plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step and diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh Ziploc fresh
And hoes want to play-play
What more can I say-say?
But ha-ha-ha-ha-hah L-M-A-O
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah L-M-A-O
Laughing at haters in here
I be her favorite in here
She want to play-play
What more can I say-say?

Yeeeaah bottle of Goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose like a third grader's tooth
The shit that we on is the ultimate high
'XXL' flow that's the ultimate 'Vibe'
Park that Lambi outside just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lambi in drive watch it peel like potatoes
Holler L-M-A-O with a drunken two-step
Like I never could pass a sobriety test



Yeeeah I'm in the club acting mannish
 lenses make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world I'm off of this planet
They don't say K. Dot is here they say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted/granite like a kitchen floor
But my kitchen's marble I ride in the carpool
because I got two whores in the back of that roam
See they're all I need lyrics

Uh shoutout to Schoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker 

Tire marks tire marks finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I'm a runaway slave uhh
Walking on water and running on waves God MC
Oh my God you gotta see there's never no Is in me
Of an odyssey I'm a block away
Fire marshals moving in marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I'm so appalled with a prototype with a guy named Protocol
You an amateur they want a pro' to call
I'll damage on camera in Compton in Canada I don't care where ya are
Just blink twice and I'm there where ya are
like a shadow in the dark you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot throw crack rock
like bam bam nigga have two grams nigga
Pay up or blam blam nigga have the black cam'
We can go Dipset  nigga
I've been around niggas killers pimps
You ain't been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Jumped off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in '9-6
Kick in the do'
Canines was all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on a Sunday we should have went to church
Look at my shirt Polo on it
It's gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the twenty-ten Romans' empire
HiiiPoWeR H.P. in ya face like H.D.
And I spit like an H.K. I'ma shop like an H3
H-U-B-C-I-T-Y A-D-N-Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me nigga
Cause I'm going out with a fist raised
and a fistful of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
with a democratic politician from C.A.
They don't wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free Js put us in the PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
Goddamn your call
Marketing base where your goddamn barcode?
Stuck in the street was dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your goddamn heart go?
Although I'm in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit
When I got my first chain all them niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit get it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny
Tryna talk back and shit like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I'm being myself my B-F-F is a B-M-W
with your B-M in it and a stash box glove
And the medicine the doctor gave a nigga won't help
I'm at a limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a black belt
I'm better anywhere every rapper get killed
like bla-bla-bla-bla! Where the knife at?
Cut-cut-cut where your life at
Career's over he's slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I'm un-sober
That's a new flow
...
Plus-plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and a sumo
and I rap here not a rapper I'm a raptor
That's a T-Rex and a v-neck for the rapture
I'm a factor in your facial
I'm a fracture to a fraction
of one half and I hate math
Pastor's like Eddie Long fucking maricone
Took me mighty long to get here nigga FUCK!

Told ya I was gonna fall off Q
We recording? You got that shit?
(Yeah yeah) Ugly our ugly ass 
(Fuck all that lyrics

And no 360 deals see that's advance at McDonald's

Time and time again I often wonder where the time go my daddy and my mom know
I stomp a rapper like a Kappa or beat him like a congo
Then speed off in a Bronco OJ
Often reminisce about the old days Hardaway/Alonzo
Back then we was wearing LA gears with the rhinestones
Nowadays I'm coming headfirst like a rhino
I rhyme like I invented it my wordplay is unlimited
Now nigga spin my vinyl club going apeshit
Rap like I ain't ate shit shit on any A-list
Artist you a novice I'm recording on a spaceship
And we never nodded to your sing-le King K

Closeminded niggas getting clotheslined I suppose
Bitch I think I'm 2pac

Walk up first we already in hell pass the blunt devil
Ya talking illuminati I'm talking eliminating
Everyone including Satan Lord knows heaven waiting

As my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff
I begin to catapult off the cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that were not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Haha LMFAO I hate yall but I spread love like mayo
That spreads slugs
My brain matter is a brain fatter
See my vision or my visionll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so
You copping fitted caps Im about to go and cop a halo
rap and I mean it lyrics

Mic check Ali
The mic don't sound right


Even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot (Ali get it right)
Even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot


Uhh tell 'em I got plenty arson to sell 'em
Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldom-
ly I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the  like I had three felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
and a corpse is just another homi' taking it's course
Of course my dream was to play in the final four
till twelfth grade came and I was only five-four
So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job he inquired
But ignorance is bliss that's what I was told
I stopped dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
with a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable
to run into a lot of crime I wrote it in my rhymes
and when I left the porch this is what I realised


Even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot {yeah yeah yeah}
Even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
Even a shooter can get shot {yeah yeah yeah so what's up?}
(These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners .45s and gauges
That could really get outrageous)


So I'm thinking to myself what's next?
My security job only got me like two checks
My pops disappointed told me I'm fucking up
Irresponsible and I needed some growing up
I told him I would go back knowing I wouldn't go back
Working a nine-to-five is something I couldn't stomach
Surrounded by the violence all the goons and the goblins
With ninety-nine problems I still kept it one-hundred
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when you're black and just turned eighteen
So what's a kid to do when you're fresh out of school
and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman Compton sheriffs all like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy fifteen fifteen and he holding a .45
Thirty years apart thirty years before he realised




Uhh soon as the beat drop
I bet some heat pop on a block close to you
Like a relative you sipping Belvedere
while these niggas planning to rob Mr. Belvedere yeah
I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther
But it seems like all my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas banking on you is something that you'll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your Ruger
Whatever you do just make sure that you willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
cause you stopped at the light five minutes from midnight
with no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening but you don't hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here when I lost my very first job
My pops said  I said I couldn't aim for the sky
Cause even shooters can get shot get shot


These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners lyrics

Rare Breed Kendrick Lamar
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up

This is for my niggas that be all blacked out
Hit the streets a hundred deep what Rare Breed about?
Riding hard bending corners the girlies on us
Leave a hater scarred big Dressers sit at the stop light
Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight
You do it right or don't do it at all
Put that candy paint on it ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats custom brakes hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like bynum and gasol aw
You know that killer californication
When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling chasing
Dreams hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
It's abomination how we bomb yo' block
I'm talking Big Punch K-Dub Baby Slip Billy
Bad Azz Rare Breed we all we got
See 'em out show 'em love chunk the deuce give it up
It's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard nope


Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop don't stop)
Breed up or speed up I'm a Rare Breed baby

And it's like that to the death though
Two-oh-point and seeing decimals I ain't lying
Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
Or we might be in a hood near you
Around the globe baby Rare Breed under control baby
Them pipes loud the movement entice crowds
We heat it up in the cold baby
It's three degrees out? Then you should see me out
Or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
Ha-ha we be the father of Harley drivers so don't bother
Show you infants how to whip it have a bye-bye
Posers try to hang? Then we hang 'em by the collar
Silk lannie Rare Breed family
Stunting hard like a black circus voila
Breed up or speed up get ahead
So with that said lyrics

"This this this should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential"


Life's a bitch life's a bitch
But I'ma keep the pussy wet yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet yep
My dick hard her pussy wet

And I'm born with my dick in the earth you can tell me how much am I worth?
I'ma die with my heart on my sleeve many die on their hands and their knees
And I'm taking whatever I need and I'm raping the government fees
And you're wasting your time and I'm speaking my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I'm Richard Pryor with priors of thirty-two fiends
And that means that I here fly higher tell me why are you staring at me?
Matter of fact man your eyes is wired you inspired by Kendrick the King
Maybe it's cause I'm living my dream man I sing what I'm living about
in the words that come out of my mouth they requires a random routine
of being organic granite then my access is granted
to represent the shit that I conceive and I guarantee that I'ma bring
my mind body and soul and I sold all these records off being myself
And I wish you can do the same thing man it's easier than a stripper
or tying a baby shoestring you stringing along
And really why you writing a song? Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch who gives a shit? You can believe


I'ma keep the pussy wet yep
I'ma keep the pussy wet yep
My dick hard her pussy wet
I'ma keep the pussy wet yep
 I came  I went
 I came  I went
 I came  I went
Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch... 

And I see that you envy of me enemy ghosts don't prosper
Better yet they do die eventually if I'm at the event you will leave
cause you know and I know that I go +H.A.M.+ even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I'm near you but I don't hear you can you hear this breathe?
With an oxygen mask and the masses keep saying I'm speaking for them
And if you can imagine my madness then you can see where I've been
And the places the Louis has been and I swear I've been doing this when
you was in pajamas watching B-B-Barney and-and Friends
And you couldn't harm me even with ten weapons of your choice riding in
army tanks you shot blanks and I shot back made your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don't think then I'm right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink? Thinking I can't write these raps in the Lions' Den
When I hear that you lying then it's murder she wrote ain't no hope
You go downhill man where's your slope? Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Tell the world to put intervals man I swear this the antidote
And they tell me that life is a bitch who gives a shit when you know that



And I see that you envy of me
Don't prosper better yet they do die eventually
cause you know and I know that I go  even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I'm near you

Hold up is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school
J-305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit

You said I won't ride until Kendrick drive a new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride I tried to improv but no freestyle I never do
Ya lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti'
Ya overlookin' every nigga that ain't quite ready
To make it rain on ya like I'm boutta break a levee 
That pussy petty
Yeah ya nails did ya hair did your cellphone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a hummer her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make ya mine.. 
Tried to make some time.. 
But I ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line.. 
Her dream soap Versace she fall for Armani
I only deal with rich niggas fuck you and Mitt Romney
I'm grown now I'm on my own now I'm poppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now I got options
Fast forward lyrics

I'm way past gone and I just see the bottom of this bottle
I just woke up to a room full of models
Who know that I ain't calling them tomorrow
It's been so long since I have been on this level right here
Waking up after I pass out I put my clothes on before I mash out
Cause I've been loosing my mind wasting my time
Fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get in aside
Playing the part and feeling them lies
Shawty says she need a ride
I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Next in my room I hit her from behind
Doing and doing like I'm pressing rewind


Cause I have never baby sitting I be lining up shots
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I wash them apart
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it all


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank


Now I done grew up
Round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in the dark room
Loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
That I'm a get fucked up fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me:


Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank


Okay now open your mind up and listen to me Kendrick
I'm your conscience if you do not hear me
Then you will be history Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'm a drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me


Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank


I ride you ride bang
One chopper one hundred shots bang
Hop out. Do you; bang?
Two chopper two hundred shots bang
I ride you ride bang
One chopper one hundred shots bang
Hop out do you bang
Two chopper two hundred shots bang


Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded lyrics

Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

30 millions later my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel round the atlas in this spaceship candy-coated
My day shift's been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals 3.14
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up
Lampin' in Jamaica the cloud's turnin' my thought's turnin'
Burnin' castor oil I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I'm satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcends two surfaces
The richer the poorer the bigger the picture
The more blood pours but...

Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk ass and crush your whole lil shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk ass you a scared little bitch
Tiptoein' around my name nigga ya lame
And when I get at you homie don't you just tell me you was just playin'
Oh I was just playin' with you K-Dot c'mon
You know a nigga rock with you bro
Shut the fuck up you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh you don't wanna clash? Nigga I know
I put my foot on the gas head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash I'm on a roll
Yellin' "1 2 3 4 5
I am the greatest rapper alive"
So damn great motherfucker I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill house on the beach nigga 
A condo in Compton I'm still in reach nigga 
I'm fresh out the water I'm 'bout to breach nigga
The five foot giant woke up out of his sleep nigga
Oh yeah oh yeah more cars more leers
More bars no peers no scars no fear fuck y'all sincere
I heard the whispers I curved the whispers you know what the risk is
Earth indigenous ya body reverting to stiffness
The whole world goin' mad
Bodies is adding up market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white Whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump know how we feel punk
Tell 'em that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesied on my last song you laughed at me
Oh when the shit get brackin' don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone big bro kudos to him
I was 2 Os from an M tryna be big as Em
30 millions later my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers fame and lawsuits
You looking at me in Chucks I'm looking at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playing rock papers scissors in court
And real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that drop one classic came right back
'Nother classic right back
My next album the whole industry on the ice pack
With TOC
You see the flames and my E-Y-E's
It's not a game and the whole world is going mad daddy
It's sad daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag daddy
Lee Baca on trail tryin' portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the COs watch 'em
Tables turn lesson learned my best look
You jumped sides on me now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul I'm flagrant I'm fouled
They throwin' me out you throwin' the towel
Look at the crowd they (nah I don't like that)
Look at my smile I'm smirking
Calm but urgent (that ain't the style fuck)
So many verses you live in denial 
So many verses I never run out what?
You making him nervous the music is loud
Hoe Jay Z Hall of Fame sit your punk ass down 
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping 
So that means no more playing the backseats 
My spot is solidified if you ask me 
My name is identified as 
I'll let y'all worry about a list I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is ante up this is in forever
Y'all got till April the 7th to get ya'll shit together

Let's get it!
Look look lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics








Uh a lil' Compton nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga one time
for my niggas
You know Compton nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga uh uh
Kendrick Lamar uh
Yo uh

Back with a vengeance
Back with my heart and I'm venting
Back with another war pendant salute me or shoot me
I never wore a kufi ignored my religion
I believe there's one God there's one love
and I believe if I fly we all doves
I make a way for my people to see the light
Brighter than yellow bones me and my microphone could be one
until I see BIG 'Pac see Pun but this ain't 
I can't take a  my city needs me
I gotta win the proof is in the pudding
and I've been fucking with Cosby since I was ten you damn right
Any means necessary get the campaign right
Very emotional I'm a Gemini
I love hard and I fight harder a born author
A born starter in the game for real
And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
You can't learn if mistakes ain't made
You gotta pay homage in order to get paid
You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
and you ain't getting it till you start paying jewels
Lifestyles of the young and the broke
With my hand under oath I recite these quotes
And if I ever lied then I'd die where I stand
as a pest not a man with a roach and a rat
In order to see the front had to play the back
We played our position we let y'all play yourself
Y'all made your decision we pray while we prey on competition
to flip another page of Corinthians
I see stars when I write these sentences
Words crash cars when I write these sentences
Open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
Free J-Dub kill all witnesses
Y'all better hope 2012 really real
cause the way I feel I'ma make y'all suffer
and take y'all supper
I haven't ate in the last twenty-two summers and I'm twenty-two now
It's about to go down so un-God my God
We got this art it's ours in awe
Oh I'm free
Finally I can say I'm me
The Kendrick Lamar EP a classic EP
The question concerned
I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
Hope y'all infected hope y'all ain't have no protection
Still I'm progressing room for improvement
Make room for the groom married to his music
I was at the XXL just trying to excel
Networking meanwhile my stomach turning
Wanted to be a part of it catering to my audience
J. Cole running late if he don't show up
think I can take his place? Ladies start laughing
No pun intended I ain't being sarcastic
Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
fresh off the plane I couldn't even complain
My nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name
Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future
My dude I salute ya contributing to real shit
Talk about it make the people talk about it make the world see
For every emcee that I see tryna steal flow
Tell 'em build a boat like Nore
and take 'em to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up boom
I ain't a star yet but I'm getting close to 'em
And if you see a wack artist do more than boo him
Throw him off the banister shoot him on camera
Then kill his manager than hang a banner up
that reads you can't proceed without being conceived
by one album of the nineties
On Rosecrans where you'll find me
And all my niggas is grimy but I remain the good kid
tryna make a difference where I'm from where you live
Oh no we've got to slow the city down
I told the homeboy pump his brakes
He said that he'd rather put the pump to his face
Sawed off torture
Turn the saw off scorching
Hot where I'm from the newscasters don't come
Another ratchet got dumped in the trash can
I ain't done a baby in there with it
She said postpartum did it
Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
when he was undressing said he'll only be a minute
That's why a nigga always kicking something with some feeling
I should have been a dentist I should have been a blizzard cold
Flash pose flash pose
A critic paparazzi got me on my toes
I wanna jump on 'em like a tadpole
Tadpole assholes
Tryna kill my dreams not elevate?
Those are not my dreams I'll be straight
with a little bit of passion
and a  like an Aston
Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses Jay Rock
Mykestro Bad Lucc U-N-I
Dom Kennedy MURS and Fashawn
Lady G Willie B in time
I'ma  like a motherfucker sniffing lines
Go like I've never seen a red light shine
Flow till my heart hit the flo' when I'm dying
Heart of a lion tell 'em get in line
and pass the baton I won't pass it back
I ain't good at dimes
If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
Haters better duck like I'm passing a pine
Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns
Pad of the hill that's a passion of mine
Promise I shine
like two mics under heavy strobe lights
I'ma need to mics just to get my point across
I'ma get my joint across lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










One two one two one two
One two one two one two
One two
Turn the headphones up Ali
One two
You mix with Dre right?
Turn the headphones up


When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Thats enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So Im talking to God Can you wash all these demons off me?
This last year Ive been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny only rapper that steered
A G5 gs give high-fives to me and say Kendrick just persevere.
The presents of being rare
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
Thinking How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Trying to smile in a room of killers turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
Its dark and plus hell is hot thats the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
Thats the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully I just started rappin to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother I was there when he wrote
His name on his record deal we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal once the shit hit the store
Find ourselves scrambling tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop bout to go in a drought
Q aint got a place to stay and bout to sleep on the couch
We eating off each other tray the dollar menu amount
Meanwhile the coast going hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs comfort
But I aint need it
I never screamed out the New West I didnt believe it
They brought each other down I was planning out my achievements
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head
Ill be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never asked for no hand out
In the midst of it all I recall a called when you said how
We could never resolve in The Hall of Fame
And Im with the trial with a Bible and a rifle
I play the game as I plan blow
Hollaback at me nigga
And if they said Im the one why you asking me nigga?
Cause When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Thats enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God hat make it or live your life in the matrix
Cause falling off is a sickness I heard that its quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head


Ill be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never asked for no hand out
Ill take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now
In the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
Looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
Fast forward as I wait in line for this passport
The homies was still poor was working at Jansport


Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from XXL had told him to press play
And there goes my fate now Im on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers even record with Gaga too
Lyricist of the year fuck am I supposed to do? Rock


Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
Exaggerated shit that we had rapped had came true
Thought I was aggravated when Warner had let me loose
I was honest see they was haunted when Mike Jones didnt recoup


Cool cause niggas wont outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak fans still buy it for proof
I came I saw I conquered
No shame I blame all of this on Compton
Thinking about when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game full circle they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong
The story was short film the glory of him and them
The worry of mother who dont recover when baby killed
The trial and tribulations the newer Miseducation
The view of body wasting you knew somebody who didnt make it
The angry the adolescent lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Praise to the almighty HiiiPower
Me and my niggas 
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it turn me up (My niggas on point game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point game tight)
There we go yeah turn me up


Picture plenty pussies throwing pelly guns at me
Paranoia making it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle I know I be centerfold I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of Hip-Hop
So retaliation is a must when we bend the block
My niggas dump'n out the roof 
Drive past guns blast shooting up the charts too
Me K-D-O-T put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label struck a match and then I blew bomb
C4 everywhere C4 everywhere
I got three hoes with me it smell like Dior and derrire
Decoy Dodge slow you can detour to Heaven's stair
So walk inside Hell's dungeons I just might derail something
They pussies I smell something
You douche on the daily niggas you pushin' em daisies
I push on gas on the Mercedes nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain and a dream
Became reality made some casualties my choppers scream


And now we dump'n out the roof 
Drive past guns blast shooting up the charts too
Me K-D-O-T put T-N-T inside my suit
Walk inside the label struck a match at then I blew


Niggas that thought that Good Kid gon' flop or I might go pop
Or your bitch won't drop knees when my shit drop
You're too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton we ain't have it all
Smoke a space inside the cafeteria hall
And I'm putting fear in you all
See your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct
Real people want real music the jig is up


My niggas won't put guns up


Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot it's your turn take your victory lap
King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick
That's the sky is falling the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar




This is my life and I look at it like it's my last
And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don't even think how I used to my mind is on rocket blast
And I don't even drink like I used too and I don't even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users since they want to go to rehab
Lookin' at the coke that he had matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won't say my bad see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up lyrics

Reporting live Compton California
The good kid

I'm tired of doing it
the same way gotta flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
Opinions get thrown out the window with Ron Browz
So turn me up loud so the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
and go death go death I said
Go death and stay dead a shot to the forehead to kill 'em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I'm militant as Martin Luther King and a penalty
Aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
I've got in it my genes you probably think I'm talking bout a pistol
but I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga what you worry for? I ain't tryna jock your swag
I'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant yeah


As time flies hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring I'ma
tell you why it's important
I'm not the boring I'ma
If I think and act like you do
the world will die from not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
the world will lose out on what's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music could take my place
in the world... The Relevant

I'd rather you call me that
than a typical artist you call wack
on a YouTube blog holding ARs and stacks
of ones but never could be the one
to rally communities or lead a crowd of blacks
Passion is too strong I'm pissed off
So there's a chance you get pissed on R. Kelly was in the wrong
But that don't make you an exempt
That don't make you a no-go from hitting the fence
You ain't a blood and damn sure you ain't a crip
The crowd yell  but I ain't a pimp
I'm me I'm free as a five-finger discount
See you on the flip side right after I dismount
If I ever feel like I ain't pushing myself
I'll find a cliff then push myself off the edge
like a barber at the tip of your head
That's how I settle it life or death if I ain't relevant nigga



So feel free to not mind me
if you're used to boosters drug dealers and shooters on wax
Cause most of y'all niggas fabricate facts anyway
I could easily cheat and let the four-four play like a two-on-two orgy
But I've been there and it bores me
Got to the point where it did nothing for me
At forty I want to afford not to record bullshit in my story
And I'm mad young so I'd rather do it now before my career's done
This is pain plus glory victory is here
If I cried lyrics

So I met this young lady ya know when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her you know give her my best cap but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said


A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and now it's a prize
Him believing in Buddha me believing in God
Asked me what am I doing he said 
Meditation is a must it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career ever think of your health?

A piece of land
That's what the Indian said I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt buy some property first
Profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best really you should invest
These tangible things expire don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage we blessed

A piece of nookie
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit satisfy my hunger
Do it all for a woman hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "homie come back to reality for a week"
Nookie is power cut on a new chick every night
I wouldn't be prouder you should allow it

A piece of mines
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
I go platinum from rapping I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
Make a million or more you living better than average
You losing your core following gaining it all
Put a price on my talent I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Tell me what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
I don't target your market
You ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
World tour your masters mortgage I need ya

I holler 
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die lyrics

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I rarely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnt hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success Corvettes by tomorrow

But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say Im down on my luck
And its something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money and its breaking me down to the top

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she dont give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you woman I console you woman
You feel like the universe owes you woman
Oh the anticipation hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four plus more
Can't get it right tell me do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say Im down on my luck
And its something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money and its breaking me down to the top

I love god I love speed I love drank I love me
I love oceans in the deep
I love women I love me
I love God
But Im scared of god speed
Sometimes

Wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
Somebody say "Kendrick American they sho is crazy"
And I said why?
Then he looked me in the eye
He said homie you messed up
You breaking my good luck
You wishing for miracles
Living through shit youre crying hysterical
Settle for everything complain about everything
Say your soul crack my world amphetamines
You projects aint it I live in a hut
You living to keep warm
Im living to pay rent
I paid my way through
Praying to Allah
You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi
Go ish yourself you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that youre looking for dope
These days aint no compromise
Your pain aint mine half the time
A brand new excuse aint nothing to me
See I made my moves with shackled feet

Cape Town Cape Town Cape Town Cape Town
Cape Town Cape Town Cape Town

Cornrow Kenny
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits skrr
Morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits skrr skrr
Cornrow Kenny
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure play with him you get killed
Play with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence yeah we juggin like that
Act of violence yeah we juggin like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Love will give me hope and I wont relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought Id seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Me? I'm about to let my hair down on hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Top billing thats a million a show
Might blow the whole Remy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mack wop bet he do what he want

Level two level two
No Im not done
You aint gotta tell me that Im the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guarantee something that none of you want
Then hold me down and they yell something like
Rent is like twenty five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
You aint gotta tell me that Im the one
You aint gotta tell me that Im the one
You aint gotta tell me that Im the one
You aint got you aint got
You aint got you aint got
Tell me that tell me that
That I am the One
You aint got you aint got
You aint got
You aint got tell me that what Im the one
Yes lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics










I swear you people don't know Kendrick you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick I'm bout to show 'em
everything inside this human being I'm still growing
I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country I bought this out the country
Whips and chains whips and chains Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta you my brother we come from the same
modern world that's your girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the Black Visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice that's ironic huh?


Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my twenty-sixes
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
(It's the Guc' cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof BURR! BURR!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 


Aw man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights all I can do is pose
A black male on Melrose
I should get blackmailed buy my people hell Rose
Niggas that ain't had shit for four-hundred years
overcompensate by over-accessorising with gear
Many of y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of Hip Hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite cause everyday I'm contradicting?
I think of how I'm living then I watch 
I know this can't be right my conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me
I wanna move accordingly but baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone till November
to see my family tree but this a shame I'm yelling out timber




Cold oh so cold
How ironic? He bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb-ass model that in Vogues
I like 'em both I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordans off put on my Loafs
Cause nothing goes bad every time I wear 
I'm getting more ass every time I wear 
They tell me it's a fad every time I wear 
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree I pray the Lord can better me
If not he bout to strike me down like this my third felony
Them voices keep on telling me Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Lyrics









Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory thats my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know Im serious
Im ready for a war
When I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure is the perfect way
To bend you on your back
Even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver I attack
Every hole with a bomb squad sittin on the tripod
Even if he try hard he can still die hard
Run but you cant hide
White flags you can pull em out fast
And tell me your last goodbye


I will I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I gotta lose? What I gotta prove?
I guess war is my love


Make sure your next move is slick
Your best move is nothing
You know I take risk dark clouds I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist
Hop out and crushin every soldier youre with
So Im 6 for 6
Im sick with determination Ill terminate ya quick
I lead the pack I follow no rules I see the traps
I know youre close to fallin on your face
Unload reload hand me another case
Explode explode
The fire of my eyes
Is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by


I will I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I gotta lose? What I gotta prove?
I guess war is my love
War is my love

"Westside Right On Time"





I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didnt know why til I said fuck all yall
Or fuck this world or Ima fuck that girl
Good Kid m.A.A.d city watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences
Fucking right its either that or life sentences
Im relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up Im at your neck like a pendleton
Nigga I need thought bitch I need thought
24 acres and a mule best believe that
They say he got smoked like where the weed at
And everything you hope bitch nigga we that
Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was 95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when its uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shot and hit the spine
Give you dap and then we slide through your hood 3 dozen times
So whats good Im looking for a pedicure
Pink Pussy that Pop preferably the kind that dont stink
Bomb ass head uh til she cant blink
And her eyes get watery you gotta pardon me


Im so damn turnt when Im in a two door with two hoes that follow me
And you know
Westside right on time tell em hoes kudos
Eastside right on time they dont fuck with you though
In my hood getting to the money the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto dawg but
Westside right on time only thing fosho
Eastside right on time gunnin through your door uhh


I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustlin since I was 12 man Ive been through hell
Now these muthafuckers is tryna tell me I dont care
Trying to tell yall muthafuckas look yall wasnt there
Turn posted up on the block waiting for
For my niggas posted up in the county praying for bail
You coulda cost your boy aint mad it wasnt cheap
Coming for a nigga just dont sleep shit for the week
Got on my Malcolm X frames now I cop the check mane
Cause every time I speak you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb they like judo
Dont you like your bitches with an ass I like you hoe
First them bitches see me Im gone Im like pluto
Plus I keep them choppers the same they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash babay MCM
When they ask me my name I tell em MC him straight up




All praise go to the most high
All phase turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets after fucking with the police guaranteed
Last nigga did that died dont you dont you dont you
Wanna live with the AK go for only 8k
Minus 6 racks minus one on top of that
Maylay snub him out then drag him out mouth like he date raped
Daytonas bending every corner while they say




All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
And my teachers asked my woman when she smiled I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal
Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British nights or LA kids when glowing nights
Or Perry Ellis jacket I would love a swapmeet full of
Chevrolets and candy paint thats wet with Tammy on the bumper
Can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
EBGC concert and a DJ Quik on cassette
Twenty years later hi hater
