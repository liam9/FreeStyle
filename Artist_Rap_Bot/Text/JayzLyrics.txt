Jay-Z Lyrics









I'm making short term goals wonder whether foes
just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy
high stakes I got more at stake than Philly
shopping sprees coping three deuce fever I guess its fully loaded
ah yes
bouncing in the lex luger tires smoke like Buddha
50 g's to the crap shooter
niggas can't fade me
chrome socks beaming through my peripheral I see ya scheming
stop dreamin' I leave ya body steaming
niggas is feening what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening with the sound of my money machine-in
my cuff running over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it
six digits and running
y'all niggas don't want it
I got the godfather flow the don Juan Demarco
swear to god don't get it fucked up


taking out this time
to give you a piece of my mind

but though you think you are
baby one day you'll be a star

last seen out of state where I drop my slang
I'm deep in the south kicking up top game
bouncing on the highway switching 4 lanes
screaming through the sun roof money ain't a thang
your worst fear confirmed
me and my fam roll tight like the firm
getting down for life that's right you better learn
why play with fire burn
we get together like a choir
to acquire what we desire
we do dirt like worms
produce g's like sperm
'til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
and I sip wine and spit vintage flows
but y'all don't know......
yeah yeah yeah yeah
cause you can't knock the hustle


but until that day then
I'm the one whose crazy
cause that's the way ya making me feel

I'm just trying to get mine
I don't have the time
to knock the hustle for real

y'all niggas lunching punching a clock
my function is lo make much 'n' lay back munching
sipping Remy on rocks my crew
something to watch nothing to stop
un...
...stoppable
scheme on the ice I gotta hide your crew
I gotta
let you niggas know the time like movado
my motto
stack rocks like Colorado
bottle off the champagne crystals by the bottle
it's a damn shame what you're not though  me slick like a GATO fuckin' Jay-Z
pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
straight banana's
can a nigga see me
got the US Open advantage jigga
serve like sampras play fake a rappers like a campus Le Tigre
son you're too eager
you ain't having it? good me either
lets get together and make this whole world believers
at my arraignment screaming
all these blacks got is sports and entertainment until we even
thieving as long as I'm breathing
can't knock the way a nigga eating
fuck you even


taking out this time
to give you a piece of my mind
but though you think you are
baby one day you'll be a star
but until that day then
I'm the one whose crazy
cause that's the way ya making me feel
I'm just trying to get mine lyrics

You know how we do Roc-a-Fella... forever... You can catch me
skatin through your town puttin it down y'all relatin
No waitin I'll make your block infrared hot I'm like Satan
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle y'all think a nigga love to
hustle behind the wheel tryin to escape my trouble
kids stop they greetin me I'm talkin sweet to keys
Cursin the very God that bought this wreath to be
My life is based on sacrifices jewels like ices
and fools that think I slip you fuck around
you get your guys hit they built me to be filthy
on some I-do-or-die shit for real
The price of leather's got me deeper than ever and
just think with this here I'm tryin to feel made nig-ga

Politics as us-ual... I took my
Frito to Tito in the district blessed me with some
VS somethins I can live with stop frontin
And for the dough I raise gotta get shit appraised
No disrespect to you make sure you word is true
I'm takin wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson
have a major night off that's clean money the tax write-off
You ain't seen money in your life when it
comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice
A smokin bro who pump Willie Ike spokes
The furthest you Chiles been is the Pocanos
My portfolio reads: leads to Don Corleone nigga please
Ten year feleon heavy on the wrist our face used
with the diamond blooded Jesus and blind your face
youse for life... sharight Jigga I keep it tight nig-ga

Politics as us-ual...
You feel my triumph never feel my pain I'm lyin
Low in the leather Zion the best that's ever came
The game changes like my mind just ain't right
We 'gwan get this dough I guess it ain't your night
Suckin me in like a vacumn I remember
tellin my family I'll be back soon that was December
Eighty-five and Jay-Z rise ten years later
got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot in the Ac' act a lot
Got matchin VCR's a huge Magnavox
to nitch green like spinach pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hittin towards a mil' lip a written I kill like that
chick faked me one-two cat yeah I do dat
Ain't no stoppin the champagne from poppin
the drawers from droppin the law from watchin lyrics

Pillow case to your face make the shell muffle
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle

Sprinkle coke on the floor make it drug related

While y'all pump Willie I run up in stunts silly
Scared so you sent your little mans to come kill me 
But on the contrilli I packs the mack-milli 
Squeezed off on him left them paramedics breathin soft on him 
What's ya name?

Peruvians tried to do me in I ain't paid them yet
Tryin to push 700's they ain't made them yet

Rock... on Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues

Ahh who wanna bet us that we don't touch leathers
Stack cheddars forever live treacherous all the et ceteras
To the death of us me and my confidants we shine
You feel the ambiance y'all niggaz just rhyme
By the ounce dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine we illuminate the whole show; you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street let alone the heat
Fuck em we hate a nigga lovin this life
In all possible ways know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
On the Uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin this is a minor set back
Yo still in all we livin just dream about the get back
That made him smile though his eyes said 
I'll do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest it's a slow process
and I ain't got nothin but time
I had near brushes not to mention three shots
close range never touched me divine intervention
Can't stop I from drinkin Mai-Tai's with Ta Ta
Down in Nevada ha ha Poppa word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap I was crazy straight
Potnah I'm still spendin money from eighty-eight... what?



Geyeah know what? I'll make..
you and your wack mans fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly ad-vance you copy me
like white crystals I gross the most
at the end of the fiscal year than these niggaz can wish to
The dead presidential canidate
with the sprinkles and the presidental ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime fleas my mind
All sneak thieves and playa haters can shine
But until then I keep the trillion cut diamonds shinin brilliant
I'll tell you half the story the rest you fill it in
Long as the villian win
I spend Japan yen attend major events
Catch me in the joints convinced my iguanas is bitin
J-A-Y hyphen controllin manipulatin
I got a good life man pounds and pence
Nuff dollars make sense while you ride the bench
Catch me swinging for the fence
Dead Presidents ya know



Uh-huh yeah uh-huh so be it
The Soviet The Unified Steady Flow
You already know you light I'm heavy roll heavy dough
Mic macheted your flow your paper falls slow
like confetti mines a steady grow bet he glow
Pay five dead it from blow better believe I have
eleven sixty to show my doe flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z The Icon baby you like Dom maybe this Cristal's
to change your life huh roll with the winners
Heavy spenders like hit records: Roc-A-Fella
Don't get it corrected this shit is perfected 
from chips to chicks just drivin a Lexus
Make it without your gun we takin everything you brung
We cake and you niggaz is fake and we gettin it done
Crime Family well connected Jay-Z
And you fake thugs is Unplugged like MTV
I empty three take your treasure my pleasure
Dead presidentials lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics









I'm feelin it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin it feel the Lex pushin up on the set
I'm feelin it through the high that you get from the lie
Feelin it if you feel it raise your l in the sky



I keep it realer than most I know your feelin it
Cristal on ice I like to toast I keep on spillin it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes lookin ill and shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch 
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas wit some shit that a light they life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone would be each others crutches 
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger lookin gully in the joint 
If y'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?





Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin 
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin what shorty

Maintainin puttin myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm livin the ill streets blues got you hunger painin
Nothin to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singin fool
I'm thorough in every boro my name be ringin
Warmin it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and 
Ya Feelin it? to all the girls I bought the girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit 
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit 
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers cant really know I'm lovin it ya feelin it





What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay high? 
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop 
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares mom
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills
But these mils make me hot y'all feel me
Enough to stop the illin right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
I'm so confused
OK I'm gettin weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself
Look I don't need that now 
It just once in a blue moon when there's nothin to do and
The tension's too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zonin lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics








Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body.

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Secret Society Tryin to keep their eye on me

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body.

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
I can't Die I can't Die I can't Die 

(Uh yeah)
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak
We're all trying to win but then again
Maybe it's for the best though 'cause when your're saying too much
You know they're trying to get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld granted
Nine to five is how ya survive I ain't trying to survive
I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it alive
Life ills poison my body
I used to say 'fuck mic skills ' and never prayed to God I prayed to Gotti
That's right it's wicked west life I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins endz
I break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
All the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous money and power is changing us
And now we're lethal infected with D'Evils...

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body.

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Secret Society Tryin to keep their eye on me

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body.

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
I can't Die I can't Die I can't Die 
(Yeah yeah)

We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother
My hand around her collar feeding her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
So I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever forsee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm trying to rock this bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears know she's wishing we were still close
Don't cry it is to be
In time I'll take away your miseries and make 'em mine D'Evils...

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body.

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Secret Society Tryin to keep their eye on me

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body.

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
I can't Die I can't Die I can't Die 


My flesh no nigga could test
My soul is possessed by D'Evils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
The exorcist got me doing skits like Homie
You don't know me but the whole world owe me
Strip!
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquors invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
I can't be held accountable D'Evils beating me down boo
Got me running with guys making G's telling lies that sound true
Come test me I never cower
For the love of money son I'm giving lead showers
Stop screaming you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness bet he'll never testify D'Evils...

Dear God I wonder can you save me?
I can't Die I can't Die lyrics

Yo whassup everybody this is Mariah Davis Mad Wednesday's

Wait a minute; I see my man over there Jay-Z

Why don't you come up here and kick a lil' freestyle
Put that champagne down and kick a lil' freestyle for me tonight


Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can I kick it?  
Y'all motherfuckers musta hear that Tribe Called Quest let's do it again
Can I kick it?  
Well I'm gone... check this out
Too much West coast dick-lickin and too many niggaz on a mission
Doin your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers I got my suspicions
that you're just a fish in a pool of sharks nigga listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies so if you a hoe
I'ma call you a hoe too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggaz too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
Rocked too many rhymes cocked too many nines too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
Cause too much black and too much love equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines cause too many niggaz ride mine
so I change styles every two rhymes hah what the fuck
That's 22 too's for y'all motherfuckers out there yaknahmean?
Shall I continue? Check it out what?

Can I kick it?  
Well I'm gone... yo yo yo
Copped to reach my quota push rock roll up smooth like on ya
Whole groove like hold-up swoll up
Too many faggot niggaz clockin my spendin
Exercisin you're gay like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right on the late night
without the eight right maybe you could test my weight right
I dip speak quicker than you ever seen
adminster pain next the minister's screamin your name
At your wake as I peak in look in your casket
feelin sarcastic "Look at him still sleepin"
You never ready forever petty minds stay petty
Mines thinkin longevity until I'm seventy
Livin heavenly fuck felony after felony what?
Nigga ya broke what the fuck you gon' tell me?



Jay-Z Jay-Z now you know this is a fat track 
Now this is comin on your new album on Roc-A-Fella records in ninety-six
 well it is definitely the bomb
But you know I do wanna say somethin to you I know
you've been havin a lot of problems with the law
But I know you innocent and I'm behind you 100%
Mad Wednesday's Ruby King DJ Ace Dang Dash
Roc-A-Fella Records we all behind you you can come back anytime
(Hah thanks a lot)
Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
Ace turn that music down
I smell some reefer now you see?
That's why our people don't have anything
Because we don't know how to go in places and act properly

Wait a minute wait a minute who told me shut the eff up?
Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here
I'm not gonna continue this show until you throw him out
Get him out right now then I'ma continue my speech
Thank you he's out of here now now like I was sayin
We gotta build our own business lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics








Yeah hah yeah Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin epic y'all know?
Where we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to servin
But we feel we have nothin to lose
So we offer you well we offer our lives
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watchin every nigga watchin me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep I'm tired I feel wired like codeine these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see from sellin 'caine
Til brains was fried to a fricaisse can't lie
At the time it never bothered me at the bar
Gettin my thug on properly my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority laughin hard
Happy to be escapin poverty however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks expectation
For dips for precipitation we stack chips hardly
The youth I used to be soon to see a mill' in
No more Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William
Illin for revenues Rayful Edmonds like
Channel 7 news round seven jewels hand gettin the mic
Forgettin all I ever knew convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer I know the procedure
Lock my body can't trap my mind easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin in codes since I sense you peekin
The NSX rental don't be fooled my game is mental
We both ride our town dog what you tryin to get into?
Viva Las Vegas see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time sippin margaritas
Ge-ge-geyeahhh can I live?
Can I live?

My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes in unity my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it manifest it intangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it we don't lease
We buy the whole car as you should
My confederation dead a nation EXPLODE
On detonation overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it even righteous minds go through this
True this the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level meditated like a buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of
Gettin cream let's do this it gets te-di-ous
So I keep one eye open like C-B-S ya see me
Stressed right? Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Ha-hah lyrics

but love you know these ho's be makin me weak
Y'all knows how it goes B so I stay deep


What up boo just keep me laced in the illa snakes
bank rolls and shit back rubs in the french tubs
Mackin this bitch wifee nigga 
so when you flip that coke

but now your style and I raised you
basically made you into a don

thats why I get bagets 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Vendell I'm ringin bells
so who the playa I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin
on how I fuck the best a shit
specially when Im flippin Baileys
dont give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push da Z eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin in Armani sweaters
before this rap shit 
when you was in letters and bullshit berattas
and eek classes with mo in the glasses
shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
now all your mens' up in your benz's
high post I swear you be killin me
playin inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
cuz you proved who was your wiz
when you was spinnin that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
your comisary stay pilin
how you livin large on the island
all them collects have me vex
but when you come home 
knew I was comin off wit half of dem checks
now we on the rise
your diamond mami wit the slanted eyes
holdin this grip cocked the green and the shit
Fucks no I see half the dough
Made you into a star lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics








Check one check two you know what to do

Don't like nobody commin around here fuckin wit they doe for shit
You enterprisin though

But fuck with the big dogs though I gotta bite ya
Look its out of my hands
And you gettin money round here its not in the plans
So hop yo ass out of that van head back to kansas
I'm sendin niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in calvin klien pantses
Let me guess they said it was money round here
And the rest is me stoppin you from gettin it correct?
Sorry to hear that my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that you'll see now please
Give me the room key
You're twitchin don't do that you makin me nervous
My crew well they do pack them niggas is murderous
So would ya please put your hand back in sight
They don't like to see me nervous you can understand that right?
You draw better be picasso y'know the best
Cause if this is not so ah god bless
You leave me no choice I leave you no voice
Believe me son I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done 
Now calm your boys 
Cause I'm findin it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point I'll let ya go 
Before ya leave I guess I aughta let you know I need those keys
And promise you never lyrics

Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it yeah yeah
Place Marcy Brooklyn
Actions... well y'all know the actions

Uhh I got this shorty on my block always clockin my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk he sees my money talkin
to honies hawkin I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends to cop his little sneakers and gear
then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes I moved from Levi's
to Guess to Versace now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle nobody wanna be like Michael
where I'm from just them niggaz who banned from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps it's time to put him on


It's time to come up (and hold my own weight defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 
It's time to come up (stick up my chest and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush 


I'm out here slingin bringin the drama tryin to come up
in the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here servin disturbin the peace life could be better
like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's sellin weight I'm sellin eight... balls
sixteen tryin to graduate to pushin quarters y'all
I ain't gon' sweat him I'ma let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggaz gon' see
I'm tired of bein out here round the clock
and breakin day and chasin crackers up the block for my pay
I'm stayin fresh so chickens check
I'm tryin to step up to the next level pushin Vettes to the Jets
Diamonds reflect from the sun directly in your equilibirum
and stunned I'm waitin for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge I don't wanna lifetime sentence
just give me the word



 Hey fella I been watchin you clockin
 Who me holdin down this block it ain't nothin
You the man nigga now stop frontin
 Hahahh I like your style
 Nah I like YO' style
 Let's drive around awhile
 Cool nigga
 Here's a thou'
 A G? I ride witchu for free
I want the longterm riches and bitches
 Have it all; now listen to me
You let them other niggaz get the name skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep yo' shit the same
 On the low?
 Yeah the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly
 AND THEN YOU BLOW!
 Hey keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards
 Then he through dealin I understand
 Don't blow your dough on hotties
 The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
and won't break em for nobody!
 Hah I like resume pick a day lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics









Hah hah hah hah yeah yeah
What it is player?
You player it's all about you
How you gon' say that man
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in
Far as I'm concerned if I had your hand I cut mines off
Hah man you know man I'm just dealin that hoe money
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sho' money
Check this out man when you run up on your bitch
this this is what you tell her
Stick they hands in they panties grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window drop it like it's hot


Uhh I talk jewels and spit diamonds all cherry
like a hymen when I'm rhymin with remarkable timin
Caviar and silk dreams my voice is linen
Spittin venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember my shit is col-l-l-ld like December
Smoother than Persian rugs the cashmere
chromosomes make a nigga Jigga Jay-Z lethal drugs
Eighteen carat gold pen when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rappin em through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon you been warned
Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don smell of Dom on my breath as I
yawn  when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know Jay's about gettin dough
Spittin flow like fine wines down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honies hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette when I drop the subject verb
then the predicate with this rich nigga preterite
I'm solid gold I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D now
notice the child swift like a locust
Focus on the loc' I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi from Rio Degenero
Worn da red eye yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rappin then slide like satin
You know the black eye white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce I hit you with this advice
Life's short so play hard and stick hard
and the only time you love em is when your dick hard

Whoooh! That's cashmere baby
Nah you know that's just laid back man
Man shit J to the A to the Y to the Z
Yeah baby
Motherfuckin pimp that's what he be
Cashmere baby
Don't get no hotter than that
Sho' you're right
Them niggaz know

Check it out check it out
Ghettoes Errol Flynn hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your burough in
I gotta keep your tricks intact
Cause I walk like a p-iyimp talk like a mack man
The star player the golden bar layer
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah sho' yo right
I'm game tight so watch it it change to night
Go tell your peeps dawg I'm lethal til it ain't right
I pimp hard on a trick look
Fuck if your leg broke bitch lyrics

Aiyyo Jay word up; these motherfuckers
Fuckin talkin that comeback shit like they cookin crack
Shit I ain't frontin all I want my pockets green like slum change
Yaknahmsayin? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers motherfucker
For real; with no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown Roc-A-Fella click nigga

Aiyyo we pattin down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gaspin for air in Aspen
Searchin for aspirin when I ask then we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast hostess hostile colossal money flarin
like nostrils for drug dealin apostles huh
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me Jay and Primo got it sewed across the board like poquino
Teflon make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
with my man I'll stock a few G's now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with cristals get fucked with pistols
just to see my shit discharge puss
I drop the stellar even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella



Yeah bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thang



Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro spent spanish wisdoms
in a whip with dinero crime organized like the pharoah
I cream I diamond gleam
High post like Akiem got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens I gotta keep my steam
Niggaz wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile here's somethin dope for y'all to lean
Liason for days on in
Money make the world go around so I made songs to spin
Can I Live did dough with my nigs dividends flow
like the Mississippi riv' lookin jig'
Can't do for dolo had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco mano a mano
you ain't ready I find no trigger straight up shoot my guns
horizontal get your weight up I am
two point two pounds you're barely a hundred and twenty-five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge do the few dollars I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you what the fuck...

 - 


Money is power
I'm into cheddick with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread letters you move you're deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the cristal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Cowboys or Benzes like we foulin in the U.N.
So what the fuck you doin?
Whatever nigga Fahrvegnugen rugged yet polished
Spankin dollars with the commas
bangin bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada fly frather
Fry hotter you die gotta
Fuck with me witness manana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callous
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggaz off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feedin me
Steam a nigga schemin on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

Stress
Sunshine geyeah

I sold it all from crack to o-pium in third person
I don't wanna see em so I'm rehearsin
with my peoples high to GM from a remote lo-cation
in the BM scopin the whole situation like 
Metamorphic as the dope turns to cre-am
but one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read em the windows to his soul
are half closed I put the key in
Pulled off slow hopin my people flee-in
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape exchangin dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaitin call from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time... stress... givin this shit up... fuck



This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop don't forget
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
And through our travels we get seperated never forget
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets

As sure as this Earth is turning souls burning
in search of higher learning turning in every direction seeking direction
My moms cryin cause her insides are dyin
her son tryin her patience keep her heart racin
A million beats a minute I know I push you to your limit
but it's this game love I'm caught up all in it
They make it so you can't prevent it never give it
you gotta take it can't fake it I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin cause I sense danger
like Camp Crystal Lake and
don't wanna shoot him but I got him trapped
within this infrared dot bout to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions no time shit stressin
My life found I got ta live for the right now
Time waits for no man can't turn back the hands
once it's too late gotta learn to live with regrets



You used to hold me told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could posess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets... 


I found myself reminiscin remember this one
when he was here he was crazy nice with his son
I miss him long as I'm livin he's livin through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven lookin over me or in hell keepin it cozy
I'm comin life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton mutual friend well me and him feudin
On your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggaz think they guns can stop foe niggaz
Frontin like they're Big Willie but really old niggaz
Hoe niggaz this year I'm sho' niggaz think I'm slippin
I'm bought to send you a roommate no bullshittin
for my hustle's goin too well to hit him
You was right niggaz want you to be miserable wit em
Anyway I ain't tryin to hear it I think I'm touched
this whole verse I been talkin to your spirit a little too much

Geyeah y'all nigaas finished yo

You finished nigga huh huh y'all finished
Can I live huh

Yo yo...yo I blacks out I pulls the mack out
Scream "Whats that about" then I clap out
I get my plot on in my drop on
Through the rotten dont even hate on those who hate me
I got popped on feelin' it 
Chickens are ice grillin' it
Cops pullin' it over Jigga react militant
Speed off officer told me to turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher then return the devils fire
I'm raised different reactin' situations
Niggas lay stiff and rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows create criminal O's
Sing along if you with me til the end of the road
I'm cynical when in the view of the public
And this is because I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who dont understand is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself what percentage is you?

Can I live
For all my niggas with all white airforce ones and black guns stack ones yo
Can I live 
For all my chicks pigeons hoes stand bow legged like the bulldog know what 
I mean huh?
Can I live
To all the ce-lo champs two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll 
heads yo
Can I live
To all my niggas who drink hennesy straight cop mix tapes and sell weight 
niggas


I got the feds sending me letters 'cause Im schooling the youth
But they cant lock me down 'cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living thats a given
Why is it? why dont y'all try to visit the neighboorhoods I lived in
My mind been through hell my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeatin' itself
Ran into shorty boppin' down the ave
On his way to clockin' mad then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said


Aiyyo theres money I there I just gotta have
When I catch up to these feinds Im'a knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag sometimes I look at life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not a ???
When I backed out let one one let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots that its my block to burn
That credit you dead it I know heads gettin' annoyed and knew all
About a dope feind before reading donald goings
Flipping boying using the right cut
One thing thats fucked up is bad dope that I cant pump
This slab gotta re-up and rebag blend it in with the raw
Bubble it fast cop more once I get it I got it I lock it
Nobody pop shit selling twenties on my block bitch
For some blacktop shit
What you want nigga what you want nigga
What you want what you want nigga

Can I live...
To all my niggas that hold coke and they bubble coat
Tryin' to win in the construction Timbs yo
Can I live...
Yo USA all my chicks that strip boo's go to the store with the dewey pins 
still in
All my chicks with the credit card scams two kids one job and no man
All my chicks gettin' that washing set with their welfare check
All the mommies dame besa alright?
All my niggas rockin' them fifty cats tryin' to get at this rap
Know what I mean?
All my cats with open cases big cars and no licenses I like that shit

Uhh yeah
What the deal playboy just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit the commision remains
Niggaz can cross the T's and dots the I's
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm takin this rap shit serious to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix watch me rise
Basics in the basement waste it
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
my hatred is fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine what?


You belong to the city (The city is mine what-what-what)
You belong to the night (Ge-ge-geyeah uh-uhh-uh pa-pau)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night (The city is mine that's right...)

[Verse Two: Jay-Z
Y'all want to know how I flow just seek and you find
I'm like a brain in the voicebox I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mami either I'm
the illest nigga doing it or these niggaz is losin it
I read a article that said I was ruinin shit
But every time I look I'm movin units in quick
So I'ma hit y'all with these last two and split
and leave niggaz with nothing but my influences-es
Soon it's the Jigga I ain't mad yeah bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Roley and just ice my shit
on the spot fuck comin back twice to shit
How real is that? My floss game still intact
Boss game you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 and 89
and drove it up to 55th the city is mine what?


You belong to the city 
You belong to the night (Yeah uhh the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (Pa-pa feel me)
He's a man of the night (Yeah yeah bounce bounce)


I snatch your girl cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus ya don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hatin and take bricks
Had it locked til I came in the club Take 6
Got your chick cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure hair done by Dominicans all for what
So I could be in a dark corner all in the butt
at the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot Louis the Thirteenth
Jay-Z Roc-A-Fella yo know the name
I ain't a player get it right I'm controllin the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'ma stand firm holdin my aim feel me?
I'm the focal point like Biggie in his prime
on the low though - shhhhh lyrics

Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
Okay I'm reloaded!



I did it again niggaz
Fucked up right? I know
I know what y'all niggaz asking yourself
Is he gonna ever fall off?
No...

...a lot of speculation
on the monies I've made honeys I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or dealt with direct
Is it true he slay the beef and slept with a tech?
What's the position you hold? Can you really match
a triple platinum artist buck by buck by only a single goin gold?
Roc-A-Fella ship fold and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O
For the millionth time askin me
Questions like Wendy Williams harrassin me
then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinnin on my sleeve
Uh nice watch do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so what block?
What you doin in L.A. with phillipinos and ese's
Latinos and Cheve's down by Pico withh Frederico
I answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is how bad you want to know? BLAOW!

Roc-A-Fella y'all uhh uh
Know my style

Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more bout crime no more
Til I'm no more cause I'm so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasn't for me niggaz still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back admirin yours
Young blood you better get that we frying baccars
Niggaz don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And don't listen to the rappers they dying to floss
I used to be O.T. applyin the force
Shoot up the whole block then the iron I toss
Come back with the click playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gonna be
Burnt the turnpike wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed till they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read 'He Was Holdin No Leaks'
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game Jigga the old-G
On MTV telling em how I sold D
And used to back work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie started out coldies
Picked the mailbox lock cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'
Then I went low key but now I'm back it's on
Motherfuckers
Jigga uh-huh yeah
Roc-A-Fella y'all
Uhh lyrics

Peep the scripts
Gold honey from the whips
Jumped out like YO! 
Who the fuck you with
Flash the juice 'cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes ***
Natural - Can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name but didn't want to jump the gun
I Didn't Know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different 
Let you push the 6
And give you a different life and
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning
And ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you real jury when it hits the light
Bitches are momentarily lose they sight
She said


I know what boys like

So want a cutie with a booty like OW!
Deeper than the MOW!

But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens - Get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marvel Forts is for matching Rolls Royce's
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I blaze the cut with the daddy raw buff
You can call me a slut
Who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit

On the place jetski's park by the lake
No neighbors make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
Better make their way through 
The Benz's and the Rovers before they reach the door
Vacate hey wait a week or more
First class to and fro freakin off
Got the ham things lot

Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop rembrandt handle pay the lot
Can't complain we balling true or not?

Yeah
I mean like
I gotta be like the pioneer to this shit you know
I was popping that Cristal
when all y'all niggaz thought it was beer and shit you know
Wearing that platinum shit
when all y'all chicks thought it was silver and shit
I got to be the pioneer of this shit
Bottom line
I'm going to show you how to do it
Check it


I spit that other shit 
That's the nice motherfucker shit
Fed time follow me around deep cover shit nigga
You beer money I'm all year money
I'm popping you ain't got to count it it's all there money
I never change money 'cause niggas got strange money
Knocked up marked up fucked up in the game money
I got bail money XXL money 
You got flash now one time we'll reveal money
I spit the hottest shit you need it I got it shit
That down South Master P Bout It Bout It shit
I got blood money straight up thug money
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money 
You got show dough little to no dough
Sell a bunch of records and you still owe dough 
I got 900 and 96 plus 4 more dough
You crazy you full gazy and loco with dough papo



Imaginary Players


And now you got these young cats acting like they slung cats
All in they dumb rap talking about how they funds stack
When I see them in the street I don't see none of that
Bad playboy where the fuck is the hummer at?
Where is all the ice with all the platinum under that?
Those ain't rolex diamonds what the fuck you done to that?
Y'all rapping-ass niggas y'all funny to me
Selling records being you but still you want to be me
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
And still you running around thinking you got something on me
But I done did it
And y'all want to take my flow and run with it
That's cool I was the first one with it
Original jiggas the future flow digital
Still busting a gat when she gets critical
Sit it down I don't want y'all to get it confused
I rip it down like I ain't got nothing to lose




Groupies I leave them all fucked 
Niggas - all struck
Your single was 99 cents mines was 4 bucks
Last year when niggas thought it was all up
But this year I've done it again jigga! 
What the fuck
Nigga stop whining jigga still shining
Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds
Rock more Versace ain't nothing sweet
I still throw t'ree in your body fleeing the party
Y'all can't go with me nope flow with me 
Bet 50 not dollars either I brought some dough with me
I flow like the 5 series in various areas
And blow holes in your weak niggas theories
It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game
You bought a 4.0 you better get your change
Ain't no platinum in those Cartiers switch your frame
Ain't no manicures on board lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics








Uh-huh uh huh uh
Gee-gee-geyeah
Baby watchin streets
Uh-huh uh huh uh
You don't have to look
Uh-huh uh
The streets is watching
Check it check
Uh-huh uh check

Look if I shoot you I'm brainless
But if you shoot me then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do?
When the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break make your first mistake
Can't ignore it that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money at twenty-five I can't afford it
Beef is sorted like Godiva chocolates
niggaz you bought it I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme you're operating on fuck time
Y'all niggaz ain't worth my shells all y'all niggaz
tryin to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to John McNale
The type to start a beef then run to the cops
When I see you in the street got one in the drop
Would I rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop
The streets is watching


When the streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

Now it's hard not to kill niggaz
It's like a full time job not to kill niggaz can't chill
the streets is watching you when you froze your arms
niggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm
Can't get caught with your feet up gotta keep your heat up
Sweet niggaz running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
Once you're tagged lame the game is follow the leader
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
Kidnap niggaz wanna steal ya
Broke niggaz want no cash they just wanna kill ya
for the name niggaz don't know the rules
Disrespectin the game want you to blow your cool
Force your hand of course that man's plottin
Smarten up the streets is watching it's on



My street mentality flip bricks forever know me and money
we like armed co-defendants nigga we stick together
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
Hustle harder to see if indictment time came around
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found
Put in twenty-four hour shifts but that ain't me now
Got a face too easy to trace niggaz mouths got slow leaks
Had to hide between my workers couldn't play those streets
She got his face like Mercury you jerkin me? Hectic
Had to call upon my wolves to send niggaz the message
I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here
I'm trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycare'
Hey there's money to be made and niggaz got the picture
Stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
Then hard times fell upon us half of my staff
had warrants the other half in the casket lay dormant
I felt like life was cheating me for the first time
in my life I was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that?
I'm playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back
like bad coke pimp or die was my mindframe bad
Was niggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack?
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that just trying to maintain a stack
and knock a lot like two trains that's on the same track
'Fore I get my life together like the oars I bring back
In the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
Got my transporter take it 'cross the border then stop
Set up shop with a quarter of rock here's the plan
For three straight weeks niggaz slaughtered the block
But you know the game is 'lluted fucked up me and my dues
One drop can wipe a nigga out faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
Half of my niggaz got time we done real things
By ninety-four became the subject of half of y'all niggaz rhymes
Public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets
The life and times of a demonic mind excited with crime
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
I figured 'Shit why risk myself I just write it in rhymes
And let you feel me and if you don't like it then fine'
The mindstate lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics








I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air one woke him
Sun-soaking sweating in his bed like Dunlo
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit
I said yeah remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now you try to rise I wave the gun - lay down
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now
I try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
And it wasn't afterthought that maybe you'll try to revenge me
But I was like  Chromes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun 
Yeah I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my mind's like a flower in bloom
*** my eyes just scower the room
I'm alert plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out in a 2 hotel town? 
Come on now I peep your Lexus at you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested rudely interrupted
Jamaican accents *** 
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
I'm done talking back up and clap them one in the abdomen 
Do me a favor dude get 2 ice cubes I pass them
Take that ice up for the nicest MC
And please yo tell BIG lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics








How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?
How can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga 
he never even met that he dont even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

Y'all dont even know every day I'm livin with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?
I'try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts fine
We'll lose two lives yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time dont let Ms. Carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
and I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God 
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars...Lucky Me


You only know what you see 
You dont understand what it takes to be me.

I hate all girls with alterior motives
That's why I'm twenty plus years old no sons no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that faggot get your own
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day Im'a have to flip c'mon
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Crist don't pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact
It aint no turning back. Bring It On
Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us.... Lucky Me

[Chorus: Karen Anderson Jay-Z]
You only know what you see 
You dont understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see 
(Since I was 4 years old I been told everything that glitters ain't gold)
You dont understand what it takes to be me 


Nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive 
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Dont grieve for me my art remains
like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life
Though I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife
Next time your thinking heist better be precise
Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here
I have no regrets even though I wanna see grow
My godsons Boogie
