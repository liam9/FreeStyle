bumpin like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slausson
on my way to the strip now I'm just flossin
Checkin my rearview cause niggaz they will do
jack moves black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
but I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggaz like lynchin but I just watch them hang
so on and so-on why don't you let me roll on
I remember back in the dayz when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak; now everybody
peepin out they windows when they hear me beatin up the streets
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say every single motherfuckin day lyrics

(feat. Snoop Doggy Dogg RBX Dat Nigga Daz)





I'ma say this and I'ma gettin mine. If you ain't down for the Africans
here in the United States period point blank. If you ain't down for the
ones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit. Devil you need to
step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in
and start puttin some funk in that ass 



Break em off sometin 



I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin in the city it's do-or-die




They wonder where me bailin and don't really understand
The reason why they take me life and me ???? hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them rion in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
niggaz start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock it down at seven o'clock then again it's like Beirut
Me don't show no love cuz it's us against them
Them never ever love me cuz it's sport to break de
and kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest 



Yes we have. There have been riots ahh rioting well I don't wanna say
rioting but there's been looting downtown but right now Bree what I want
to show you is they have started fires down at the end of the street 



 How many niggaz are ready to lose?
 Yeah so what you wanna do?
 What you wanna do?
 I said how many niggas are ready to lose
 Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9 



Nobody told us today in otherwords 
You're still a slave. No matter how
much money you got you still ain't shit 

 

Sittin in my livin room calm and collected 
Feelin mad gotta get mine respected
cuz what I just heard broke me in half
and half the niggaz I know plus the niggaz on the Row is bailin
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central Los Angeles
They find that they couldn't handle us
Bloods Crips on the same squad
with the Ese's thumpin nigga it's time ta rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthin lovely biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so they can't love me)
Yo straight puttin down gettin my scoot on
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on
and come up on me some furniture or sometin
Got a VCR
in the back of my car
that I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
Cuz they will see that I can't be stopped
Cuz I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop 



There has been videotape and you can see of the aah some of the crowd
throwin things at the officers
And swingin at them as well. Like there was a young woman there. You see
she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand 



 How many niggaz are ready to lose?
 Yeah so what you wanna do?
 What you wanna do?
 I said how many niggas are ready to lose
 Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9 



I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin in the city it's do-or-die




One-time trigger happy no nigga love
187 time time to grab the glove
Can't get prints so a 9 I throw away
or get prints so my Uzi witta spray
POP POP POP another motherfucker drop
And I get relived like *?Bop Bop says?*
smash I crashed his head like a window
I ain't no dead do' I'm high off the indo
Creepin with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut
And cracker so now he best to back up
I guess I gots ta pack up fillin the clip up I zip up-
town the motherfuckin cops are all around
Helicopters flyin
These motherfuckers tryin
to catch me and stretch me on Death Row
but hell no's the poor black refuse to go 



This is now coverin a very very wide area of Los Angeles where these
fires have been aah ignited. I mean from here to the aah to the south
end of South Central is a long way 



Break em off sometin 



The outcome of this is destruction so the more fall
Niggaz don't give a fuck so tem bust and before
niggaz backin up three black shows
No justice so they copied ya right
and here I am again me turn the other cheek me
Be too many wigs got me 9 to my tights

G





One two three and to the fo'
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do'
Ready to make an entrance so back on up

Gimme the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang baby!
Two loc'ed out G's so we're crazy!
Death Row is the label that pays me!
Unfadable so please don't try to fade this 
But uh back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'm 'a let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have ta' find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man and at the same time burnin' her man
Now you know I ain't wit that shit Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
 And that's realer than real-deal Holyfield
And now you hookas and ho's know how I feel
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff


It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre creep to the mic like a phantom


Well I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creep-in'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know I flow some ol' funky shit
To add to my collection the selection
Symbolizes dope take a toke but don't choke
If ya' do ya' have no clue
O' what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do


It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
So jus' chill 'til the next episode


Fallin' back on that ass with a hellified gangsta' lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a' old batch o' collard greens
It's the capital S oh yes the fresh N-double O-P
D-O-double G-Y D-O-double G ya' see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' ho's and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah and it don't quit
I think they in a mood for some motherfucking G shit
So Dre. 
We gotta give 'em what they want (What's that G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' 
And it's gotta be bumpin' 


It's where it takes place so I'm a ask your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Droppin' the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic it's like a cookie they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfucking homie Doggy Dogg has my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'm a continue to put the rap down put the mack down
And if your bitches talk shit I have ta' put the smack down
Yeah and ya' don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off always on 'til the break dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C. no one can do it better


Like this that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those
So jus' chill lyrics

bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
bumpin like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on

The sun went down when I hit Slausson
on my way to the strip now I'm just flossin
Checkin my rearview cause niggaz they will do
jack moves black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
but I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggaz like lynchin but I just watch them hang
so on and so-on why don't you let me roll on
I remember back in the dayz when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak; now everybody
peepin out they windows when they hear me beatin up the streets
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say every single motherfuckin day lyrics

here in the United States period point blank. If you ain't down for the

I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin in the city it's do-or-die




They wonder where me bailin and don't really understand
The reason why they take me life and me ???? hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them rion in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
niggaz start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock it down at seven o'clock then again it's like Beirut
Me don't show no love cuz it's us against them
Them never ever love me cuz it's sport to break de
and kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest 



Yes we have. There have been riots ahh rioting well I don't wanna say
rioting but there's been looting downtown but right now Bree what I want
to show you is they have started fires down at the end of the street 



 How many niggaz are ready to lose?

 Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9 



Nobody told us today in otherwords 
You're still a slave. No matter how
much money you got you still ain't shit 

 

Sittin in my livin room calm and collected 
Feelin mad gotta get mine respected
cuz what I just heard broke me in half
and half the niggaz I know plus the niggaz on the Row is bailin
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central Los Angeles
They find that they couldn't handle us
Bloods Crips on the same squad
with the Ese's thumpin nigga it's time ta rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthin lovely biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so they can't love me)
Yo straight puttin down gettin my scoot on
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on
and come up on me some furniture or sometin
Got a VCR
in the back of my car
that I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
Cuz they will see that I can't be stopped
Cuz I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop 



There has been videotape and you can see of the aah some of the crowd
throwin things at the officers
And swingin at them as well. Like there was a young woman there. You see
she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand 



 How many niggaz are ready to lose?
 Yeah so what you wanna do?
 What you wanna do?
 I said how many niggas are ready to lose
 Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9 



I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin in the city it's do-or-die




One-time trigger happy no nigga love
187 time time to grab the glove
Can't get prints so a 9 I throw away
or get prints so my Uzi witta spray
POP POP POP another motherfucker drop
And I get relived like *?Bop Bop says?*

Creepin with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut
And cracker so now he best to back up
I guess I gots ta pack up fillin the clip up I zip up-
town the motherfuckin cops are all around
Helicopters flyin
These motherfuckers tryin
to catch me and stretch me on Death Row
but hell no's the poor black refuse to go 



This is now coverin a very very wide area of Los Angeles where these
fires have been aah ignited. I mean from here to the aah to the south
end of South Central is a long way

Ready to make an entrance so back on up

Gimme the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang baby!
Two loc'ed out G's so we're crazy!
Death Row is the label that pays me!
Unfadable so please don't try to fade this 
But uh back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'm 'a let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have ta' find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man and at the same time burnin' her man
Now you know I ain't wit that shit Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
 And that's realer than real-deal Holyfield
And now you hookas and ho's know how I feel
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff


It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre creep to the mic like a phantom


Well I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creep-in'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know I flow some ol' funky shit
To add to my collection the selection
Symbolizes dope take a toke but don't choke
If ya' do ya' have no clue
O' what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do


It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
So jus' chill 'til the next episode


Fallin' back on that ass with a hellified gangsta' lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a' old batch o' collard greens
It's the capital S oh yes the fresh N-double O-P
D-O-double G-Y D-O-double G ya' see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' ho's and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah and it don't quit
I think they in a mood for some motherfucking G shit
So Dre. 
We gotta give 'em what they want (What's that G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' 
And it's gotta be bumpin' 


It's where it takes place so I'm a ask your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Droppin' the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic it's like a cookie they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfucking homie Doggy Dogg has my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'm a continue to put the rap down put the mack down
And if your bitches talk shit I have ta' put the smack down
Yeah and ya' don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off always on 'til the break dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C. no one can do it better


Like this that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those
So jus' chill lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics





(feat. Snoop Doggy Dogg Dat Nigga Daz)





Wake up jumped out my bed
Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God I wonder can you save me
I'm only 18 so I'm a young buck
It's a ride if I don't scrap I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G I guess
Ese's way deep shanked two in they chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugn too late damn down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls throwing them dogs
Getting a rep as a young hog
It ain't nuttin like the street life
Betta be strapped wit yo clip cuz ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots ta handle mine
Since I did the crime I gots ta do my time 



Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility 



Now I'm 'trolling the dove sitting on swoll
27 years old off on parole stroll
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street
Things done changed but it's alright
Remember they used to thump but now they blast right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.
The little homies from the hood wit grip
Are the ones I get wit 'cause I'm down respect trip
Nigga I'm bigger than you so what'cha wanna do
Didn't know we had a 22
Straight sitting behind his back
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I use to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get 
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread 



Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility 



Something for the real OG's to get wit
Some facts made our made now you wanna run and play
Like every single day really doe
You know me I'm the smooth macadamien gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enuff to keep your sack right
Late nights I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's but they serve down
In a jeep ride east side what they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on stepped on now they gone
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke you break check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics










Who is the man with the masterplan?
A Nigga Witta motherfucking Gun!


44 reasons come to mind
Why you motherfucking brothers hard to find.
He be walkin' on the streets and fuckin' with mine.
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind.
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or LA without the AK ready to pop.
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I got to fight.
I think it's better to retellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up.
What you niggas looking at? You do in...
Goddamn 'cause it's the city.
And for a youth to survive a nigga gotta be a gangster.
And I'm a nigga you can't remove.
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To their homies they can hang by dealin' with me.
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D.
I never did time on a murder yet.
'Cause I relax and back do a job and jet.
Yo I know you understand my flow
So here we go when Death Row
Come. Let a motherfucker know...




D-R-E! A motherfucker who's known for carryin' gats
And kick raps that make snaps.
Adapts to anything violent that I'm located at.
If you see me on the solo moves believe that I'm strapped.
44 .38 or AK 47.
'Cause Mo' live with Charlie Sheen.
You want a stairway to heaven?
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat.
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop.
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go when Death Row
Come. Let a motherfucker know...




I break some off. I break some off.
Yeah I break some off. I break some off.
Yeah I break some off.
But I ain't speakin' about between the thighs.
I'm talkin' about cockin' a guage in between your eyes.
That'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realise
That a gat will make any nigga civilised.
Old buster ass nigga talkin' bullshit.
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with.
Get lit or hit up by the doctor.
A nigga to break some off properly.
Real G.
So don't doubt it.
I'm the one who's doin' it
While these other niggas talk about it.
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my 44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome.
And show him why they call me the notorious one.
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packin' a gun.
You don't believe me wanna step up and give it a try.
And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die.
But some still don't hear me though.
You're too ninny not to hear me nigga lyrics

We gotta get rid of the pimps and the pushers and then start

And we ain't askin for shit nigga we takin'

To the strip
Or take a trip bawlin' with the row

Indo smoke in ya lungs like that
And you can lift it on and a fist a bomb
Takin' away like hell at Veitnam 
California back in and on a mission makin a point
Ain't no fuckin' competition

It's strage how I re-arange and change the buisness
By droppin' shit like this

This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area 


Now I'ma kick up dust
As I begin to bust
On the wick-wack fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I pick up I lick up ya face get smacked up
when I rack up so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift then forget Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stocking
I'm knockin em out the box 'n'
Knockin em out their sock 'n'
Cuz Robin is rockin
Breakin em down to the slab
Takin em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle huh?
See ya watch and creak without a motherfuckin paddle
Rattle that brain I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
We're on you like a border you're nothin more than a crane
Or a pebble take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull then pull it uhh!
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuck
Do what I must and what I must is bust
The bubble or choose some trouble forty-due's
So stick to my Luger Lady of Rage is comin thru 

 - (Some cool shit some cool shit)


I fears no one I makes em cool off like a ploar cap
Lynchin as I hits misses the ?rollin back?
Pushin packs to make a profit
Diggy dope stuck on the topic so stop and gimme my pops kid
I'm livin large like a fat bitch
So get back bitch I'm hard to broke art so the faggots
This young black kid I'm mercenary merciless
Murderin mega some niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worst than this
Chewin motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep rippin the lyrics I'm leavin ??? ???
Rough wind flex too complex wrecks then I'm peace
So feel the wrath nigga I rip in half niggas
Ya quick ta talk shit I whip your ass nigga
So watch me blast nigga cuz I'm the last nigga
ya wanna fuck wit so up your cash nigga
I make stagger ob' skills and jimmy ragged
Home in and drag her sit wit ya girl and watch me tag her
Pullin steel like a stunt
Sold like an ID card nigga no needs ta front so
here to torment up a track on crack
and I'm strapped witta semi-toll milli-ten Mac
Yo I breaks em off I breaks em off cheap
Deadly as Jason on Friday The 13th 


Back in the days niggas they use to scrap
but now in ninety-due' niggas they pull they strap
Cuz umm police dem come wicked and dem shoot
Niggas so niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute boom stompin black soldier
Here ta teach and mould ya
The ennerator dominator narrator RB to the motherfuckin X
Flex wicked styl-e bompin be found into greed by a
Maniac with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back the bullets go
BOP BOP BOP now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it niggas goin wild everynight they shoot

Anytime ya step into my hood

For my niggas I got my niggas in the motherfuckin he-ouse
and they gon' tell yo' what's really goin on
Got my motherfuckin nigga RBX...definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker ready to kick some real shit
Y'knowhutI'msayin?
And that lil' shit cha hear in the background that's my homegirl Rage
So RBX kick this shit 


Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse cuz I'm the fuckin murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap! Adapt to this but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
in a book from a crook
You get caught slippin yo' ass gots ta die
Nigga tell me what the fuck you figure?
Trigger? Happy RBX to cap ya
POP POP and I can't wait to bust a pound
POP POP my hollow points smacks the clown
Cuz what I said split his head
And now they got me runnin from the feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed lyrics

Yes it is I says me
And although me
By morning three cause they're weak

Yes yo! I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them
But lets take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this...
Path...
Called... 



Stranded on Death Row so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggaz know the flow that I kick there's no refill
I'm murderin niggaz Yo and maybe because of the tone
I kicks my grip the mic and kick shit
Niggaz can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
Nuff respect like a sensei ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood and we up to no good
Slangin on things like a real ho
G should I'm stackin and mackin and packin a ten so
When you're slippin I slip the clip in
But ain't no steady tripppin
Cause it's Death Row rollin like the mafia
Think about whoopin some ass but what the fuck stoppin ya
Ain't nathin but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun Korrupt inmate cell block one 



No prevention from this mention of sorts
Your're a victim from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
That the grain will hit the scratch
With treachery my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm plural make it many storms
When I'm vexed I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension I'm the presenter
And the inventor and the tormentor
Deranged like the hillside strangler
MC mangler tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The narrator RBX cell block two 



Rage lyrical murderer
Stranded on Death Row
And now I'm servin a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentence
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my matress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Layin lain with the shame who's to blame
Me the lady of Rage
On when I'm comin from the D-E-A-T-H in
R-O-W takin no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage from cell block eight 



And yo steppin through the fog
And creepin through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood Doggy Dogg
Makin videos now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a quick one servin my rocks
And I'm still servin for mines peace
To my motherfuckin homies doin time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin with your blues on mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin the cops crazy
But ain't nuttin but a black thing bay-bee uhhh
No I'm not flaggin but I'm just saggin
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfuckin Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat em man
We gotta smoke em then choke em
Like the motherfuckin peter man
It's like three and to the two
And two and to the one
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done 



Yo now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong see if you can travel on
Cause only the weak will try to speak
Those who are quiet lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics





(feat. Snoop Dogg Dat Nigga Daz Kurupt Jewel)



 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks...


Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get the fuck out after you're done
And I hope in my ride to make a quick run...


I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep the shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing 'cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz


Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
 Bitch and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this

 Bitch!!




...To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to long beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I put my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe?  Why? 
'cause a hoe's a trick
We don't love them tricks  Why? 
'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out
Now...


I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking' county jail
6 months on my chest now it's time to bail
I get released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove down the block
See my girl's house Dre pass the glock
Kick in the door I look on the floor
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe yo

I uncocked my shit... I'm heart-broken but I'm still locked
Man fuck a bitch!





I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'cause I'm doin my own thingdown with the swang
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck 

And now I gotta do some...
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick hell yeah lyrics

East coast  West coast  



While childish MC's battle over coastal fronts 
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics extract morbid thoughts from the mental
custom designed for instrumental
Yes indeedy lyrical graffiti
And this one's a burner baby
Truck like Toyata driven
True and livin drivin with the gat
Uhh pop the clutch let the Cold Crush rush
Then I flush wack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush let me burst dare I gush
Cock-diezel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic 

East coast  West coast   



Yo why do they make me wanna ruin they career?
Before I bust your shit let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nutsac yo I stay focused
Beefin without skills seekin will only weaken
The artist speakin over beats and you be cheatin
Cacaphony of small talent rappers claimin a coast
over instrumentals ain't got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher hip-hopppin ya correctly
Ignorant ass MC's continue to tempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cellblock
Too many MC's rappin causin lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Just your typical non-topical
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be usin
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth
Whattyou think this is? KRS-One from the Bronx kid! 

East coast  West coast  

Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constituional rights have been suspended 



The most scandalous cut the bad apple we can handle this
Coast trippin goin on through out the business
East Coast West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from I'ma Killa Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool I can roll through any block
from Central to Westland Avenue without my glock
But some niggaz can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise better realize
True enemy lies killin in the highrise
office analyzing the song
Look at them red niggaz don't even get along
Kill that noise four niggaz bringin the skill
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill 

Yeah that's right fool you know who the mighty Group Therapy
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise! 

East coast  West coast  



Now when I bomb like Sadaam the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts are mergin at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatchin hoes up my flow's up
When the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up
It's a holdup frontin like you down for the real
to make a meal but when plan fold nigga you squeal
like Heavy Heel lyrics

Eat me freak me take your hand and leave me

Copped the Play Station but still play the Sega
and in the PJ's I DJ and blow amps
Bad as ?shrimp stampy? with the food stamps
Huh I'm not a stranger to danger
On the streets I be known as the jaw rearranger
Heavy with the metal Mel-Man rule
White boys say it now "Cool cool cool!!!"
I bring the fizzy that's the obvious
I got a grip but the only clip I load be the floppy disk
In the SP or the MV see three G
Ho's see me comin in 3-D
I spread Lizzy with ten mates
Hit the skins and I break out like an inmate
Hey yo that's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shittin on it 



 Shittin on it
 Shittin on the world

I warm it up like humidity
Mel okay I'm here til infinity
My shit be outta...space with the Ewok
This is my planet but I never wear the Reebok
When we rock to the beat of accapella
Most reigns supreme niggas grab your umbrellas
It's time to bounce so where the player mate?
Jealous MC's still drinkin on that rade
Bitches flirtin with the giggles and chuckles
You'll never get the jezzy bare knuckle
cos I get a tingle in the jimmy after three days in it
Hold up! Back to the clinic
Uhh aah poked your bitch in the eye
then I step like Omega's hifi 
I walk the earth like Moses
Any mackadocious I grew up with no chips
Shows I turn out
I got dough but still call my hos on my burnout
But can't phone long distance
I'm a rich nigga still gettin public assistance
Rockin shit on a task cam
Got MC's talkin 'bout "I love you man"
But you can't get my last bud
or my last dove outta beats we be makin
Dre and M-E-L got the whole Earth quakin
That's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shittin on it

You got guns? we got guns...
Yo I got straps we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 
'Cause it's all they worth... 


No question it's all about the D-R-E.
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree.
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M-I-C.
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea.
It's worth 8 but I only paid 5 point 3.
Worldwide got the triple beam I slide.
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo.
It's how I ride - cartel style.
Full stacked to the max now.
A million-dollar smile people wonder how.
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montigo Bay
with more chips than Frito Lay.
Flossed jewels in a tire ain't nuthin' fly.
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...




Young black Rockerfeller. Hell a swiss and mozarella.
Pockets sweller gettin' money like a bank teller.
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split.
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'.
Ladies get your paper too.
Don't expect for no man to support you.
Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos.
My woman is independent makin' dough by the case loads.
I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing.
Kick back relax and grow old with my millions.
That's where it's at. You got drama I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat.
Instead let's get paper while it's paper to get.
Private Jet 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet.
Spend a mill no sweat water the line with my wet...




This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare.
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame.
Now many people die over these dead green guys.
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise.
It's the root of all evil and sins.
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my 20-inch rims...
Moolah y'all.
Platinum plaques cover my walls.
Grindin' diamonds shinin' and without one flaw.
Get the cash the grass the ass will bounce.
Luciano and all amounts that's all that counts 'cause...

I've wondered what's goin` wrong 
To make us go through such pains & heartache 
But still I know 
That my love is so strong for you 


Should I love you? 
Should I leave you? 
So many choices 
Oh oh baby 
So many reasons why 
For me to have you near me 
So many choices 

I don't understand 
Why you wanna take me through these changes 
No no 
Ohhh 
I can't decide 
What to do when it comes to me & you 
Because my love is true 
Oh oh oh oh yeah 


Where do we go from here? 
 
I can't help but wonder 
 
Do we belong together? 
The love I feel can't be alive 



All alone 
I don't wanna lose your love 
On my own 
Just can't be without you baby lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics











As the world keeps turning chronic keeps burning
 street sermon these niggas are determined




I flow like CD's in the deck
Moosh fools in the face that lack respect
Protect ya arm pitch from the funk
I deodirise the musty ya rhymes are crusty you can't bust G
So leave me alone I'm in the zone
Walkin the streets on my own nigga get blown
Some niggas say that nigga Where is gone
But I'm low in the cut and gotta microphone
Are you gone bust or play bones?
You motherfuckin clone get off that nigga's style and get'cha own
It's Miscellane and it's on again
For the niggas that slept they shoulda stayed in step
And kept ya big fuckin mouth shut 





I woke up with a stomach ache headache back ache
Advil Tylenol Peptol slept so long realised my world is wrong
My world is gone like disco
Blowin up Cisco and in my Cammo
Standin in back of me was my soul
Thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll
Knowledge is urban-able exhaust manifold
A tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick
Shaky bitches off the dick
Cos she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips
I'm slow but equipped with the proper tools
Show me the one talkin shit so I can drop a fool
I'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he Mr CREAM
Come back on the scene and smoke a phillie G
I really dream of gettin mine now let me tell you what's silly
Me buckin with my team is murder one
I heard a gun bustin shots  down the block 
I guess a nigga gettin what he got 
Shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas
I'll fuck one for y'all they made ya last phone call
To a trick that didn't even care
Cos she was gettin fucked somewhere you're stuck in there
Now you wanna bust nigga now you wanna kill nigga 
Nigga how ya feel? 
You can't try to be real 
Shit is for real 





I'm cooler than most but I got the shorter temper
And I'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes
Let's take it back to the first side
When you was a new jack and jockin my new track
But you was wrong didn't know about the big long
Head-strong nicknamed Dav from off the school yard
Witta teenage group I'm turnin loots to tracks
Me and my niggas like 

You wanna know what the hos used to do
When me and my crew came bustin through
All sorts of blushins brew
(A neighbourhood find a gift too swift Miscellane is the crew)
Underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue
This is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front
I smoke on I broke on till I spoke on
Miscellane packin shows like Farrakhan
Where is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau
Now that's three times your tightest flow
And three times ya tightest track three times your fattest sack
Three times is clever  





Thou shalt rest in grief who lay buried in the belt
Barely included work leaves bodies scarred and hurt
To art in hell lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics










Ai Aiyo Butter is uhh Hands-On in the house
Well check it out put some shit on for em
Let's get it on kick it
Ha yeah hell yeah

Aiyo Kim what you got to say 



Well boy you're movin me
There's somethin physical about it
The way you're makin me feel
The way you're touching me can't explain
Oh I just can't keep still
When you're kissing me it gives me what I need
Hold on tight and baby do it all night 
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
I wonder how boy you make me over 


Now tell me away cos I can't stop from how you mean
The things you do to me
Has got my body wanting you more and more
Oh baby it's got it bad
Your love has got me open 



Yeah
No question kick back watch my dope eye rise
Still an everyday brother with my eyes on the prize
Take my time analysing every song that dies
Flossin the fliest rides from hits you memorise
Been doin this since days of N.W.A.
Took it to the next level when I use to DJ
Got family and fans from New York to L.A.
They keep it real cos they know that Dre come with Bombay
G's up ain't nuttin changed yo freeze up!
When I come thru player haters women one-two
The dotted Maxwell from only a minimum of set sales
Clutch your tails for honeys waitin to exhale
Keep writin til the next millenium
Tape one hit when I serve these fiends stuff mo' potent than Bolivian
Welcome to the Aftermath
Aiyo Crystal what you got to say? 



It's like I'm glowing about the animal attraction
That grows between us
And then my friends ask me just where the hell I've been
They think I'm crazy they don't understand
When you're next to me I'm lost in ecstasy
Don't let go cos I'm about to explode 
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
Baby please don't make me over 





You touch me at the spot
Ooh boy you got me high 
And when you're loving me down I never want you to stop
Just take it easy 
Baby boy you babe lyrics

Dedicated to the up city
Straight West Coast nigga ain't no pity
Put holes in niggas real pretty
Real shitty like a black Frank Nitty
I give drugs to the thugs price-free
Handed down the game by that nigga Ice-T
No doubt players like me
recognise the great King Tee about twenty grand a ki
Ah that's that G shit no doubt about that
Statutory lyrics is how I rape the rap
And get your niggas off my back
and no GOD ya don't pull a strap cos  FUCK THAT!
I'm very precise when I shoot
straight out the roof of my Lexus coupe
Ya wanna blame Tha Alkaholik group
but naw that nigga Tela must've hit the loot
Cos he's actin real loonie
and I don't give a fuck cause I'm drunk and I'm a G like Spoonie
The hoodrats wanna do me
So if you've got'cha county cheque give it to me 



Now baby don't trip it's King Tee with the gangsta shit

And the two dog groan a 50 gat to your dome

Huh so I guess I earned the title 'OG'
Been down for ten years this my fifth Lp

They call me 'Big Bone' and on my worst night I fades em all
And I come thru ya hood like a locc ass G
Rip any fool that calls hisself an MC
It's only one way let's have gun play
I make it play nigga fuck what you got to say
I got a mad crew of murderers ex-burglars
Puttin soft niggas outta service 



Now baby don't trip it's King Tee with the gangsta shit
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan all the fuckin chips blown
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone
Baby don't trip it's King Tee with the gangsta shit
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan sittin on chrome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone 

My whole crew lives illegal
Strapped with the bulletproof vest in the front and back Regal
Smokin that sticky green grass
Hittin switches bumpin on cuts from the past
We smoke leaf cos we live like G's
Super-soft niggas become enemies
I hit a lick on the East for ten ki's
now everything I drive is on Deez
I'ma make you believe I gotta put it down like a real nigga should
My dope spot in every nigga's hood
I don't waste time I need to get what's mine
Fourteen shells from behind
Leave you in the blind str-8 paralysed from ya spine
A partner of organised crime
Ya hear it all the time but now ya gotta hear it from the truth
til my nigga Karl Phat's respect due 



Now baby don't trip it's King Tee with the gangsta shit

Hmm hmm hmm yeah
You make me do yeah uh


I never can erase
The love that you have placed inside
No girl I can't deny
I just never felt that I
Would ever be the one to find
A special lady that'll make me do for love


You make me do for love
What I would not do
Cause every day my love
You got me wanting you
You make me do for love
What I'd never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
Ooh ooh


Oh no man can recognize
The love that's in the sky
I just had to let you rain all over me
Then one day it dawned on me
I had changed completely
I don't know just how it happened
But I love the way you make me do for love


You make me do for love
What I would not do
Cause every day my love
You got me missing you
You make me do for love
What I'd never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
Ooh ooh


No I never thought I'd find
What love made of me
Come on the road with me baby
I open my eyes lyrics

Yo from upstate to Brooklyn the whole borough's thorough
You know the time y'knowI'msayin?
Crown Heights to all my niggas holdin it down

(L-A-W this might trouble you) This is Sharief y'knowI'msayin?
Puttin it down for the Aftermath like this 



As I inhale the blunt and take a sip off the yac
My rhymes come to life my verbal forces attack
Can't hold me back I'm too strong I waited too long
Freestyle a whole rap tape then write a new song
Been in the game since...what? That shit is past tense
Pass the microphone and watch this nigga crack the C
with that ill shit I came to kill shit
I crack the code must be the reason they reveal shit
But in this era of mayhem
I recyc' the murderous rhymes to slay them
To all my opponents who wanna kick it I spark
the verbal scientist in your title I'm walkin wit it
A hundred dime pieces and the party got the heaters
I shine my verbal styles and got niggas climbin on speakers the thrill
seekers
An earthquake of bass lines swangin the party I'm slangin the mic
like a syllable shotty sippin 40's

I take a raptor's rough cuz I'lla date the semen
Spectators be sayin they can't go where he went
That's another level of attack  bring your bats
My DJ scratch the record like a scrotum sack
I slice the rapper like a surgeon
If he wanna battle I play him out like a priest in a turban
Too much tenacity vocal capacity

Transform I see it ain't even worth ya triggers
I'm from the days when B-boys were straight earthin niggas
Standin my arms crossed toss a grenade
rein-force my zone as a lyrical barricade
You better cuz your dome piece blown
Release chrome beats nuclear missiles rhymes under my comb
Three strikes marks the villian bustin rhymes

Some I slaughter such as *?two compel?* blows
Crush your corny kids caught stumblin on my shells so
sick too quick I stab you with some shit
Doin infinite assault these hard lyrics I commit
When I crush your lungs I keep my pace uptempo
Swingin my prison rhymes fuckin mics like a nympho

Nationowl divides this bomb to blow
Adios serials worldwide
Once inside ya ride usin the mic like a screwdriver
to break down the speed
While labels were sound asleep Nowl peeped and creeped
and stole the ground beneath they feet
Far from the bail still makin my sales
Movin tapes like weight we's hip-hop cartel
takin over no doubt
Like thongs they ass out but win amounts with the Doctor
Dre all day cash his cheques
Like Play I hittin you in the head like strays 
Nationowl's defence covers my ass
and team o' outcast niggas who're quick to blast
Our beat's on hit keep the peace on
MC's couldn't find my path  



Pledge a legiance to my team
Let's scheme nigga we gots ta get CREAM
Cos worldwide shit's outta control
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Young and old my niggas who's on parole
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Bitches who own my niggas whose heart is cold
Why you can't get down with Nationowl 

Nationowl's anthem got'cha soul on lock
still fully loaded cocked the handgun
Composed like the Phantom
while the face of earth gets ugly we ever lovely
Bitches who never duck me 
In thinkin I must spend dough til I'm dizzy
Assholes around like a frisby
And for satisfaction chew an MC like Wrigley
History's about to be made I met'cha in a way
tryin ya hardest to delay
My flight batterin keep the world ringin like *?Sadaran?*
Lyrics bone shatterin
Pretenders wantin to be Cinder-rella
What? That shoe you tryin ta wears not fittin
Now we're strippin niggas like a Chippendale
I'm rippin hell burnin the devil and inhale 



In the last days which side will you be on?
Nationowl's on the side that I beat on
I demand put me on
From the door I use MC's to wipe my feet on
My shit be bumpin like in-grown hair
For twenty-six years trained in ghetto warfare
Nigga I see more green than St. Patrick
Pro actors game of life with no practice
Controllin craps like I had a remote
It's a rule now go enter ya tomb
No joke much over I scold
It's some game for all who's tryin ta split ya coats
Best believe that these are our last years
Prepare or get done from the rear
As we move there where? The final frontier
United we stand lyrics

I'm scopin often where the spotlights shine 
Me and my crew drinkin tryin ta have a good time

Things just ain't the same for gangstas.
Times is changing young niggas is aging
Becoming old gees in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces but
The strangest things can happen from rappin when
Niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags when it happens that's it.
I've seen 'em come; I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise witnessed it and watched 'em blow.
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow.
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough.
Best friends and money: I lost them both.
Went visited niggas in the hospital.
It's all the same shit all across the globe.
I just sit back and watch the show. 


Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' 
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more 
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know 
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low 


I moved out of the hood for good you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be.
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see.
I'm out of sight now I'm out of they dang reach.
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill.
And choose a new spot if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug how much Tupac in you you got
I ain't no bitch neither.
It's either my life or your life
And I ain't leaving I like breathing.
Nigga we can go round for round
Clip for clip shit fo'-pound for pound.
Nigga if you really want to take it there we can
Just remember that you fucking with a family man.
I got a lot more to lose than you remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes. 




Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs.
They wanna hang us see us dead enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in.
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges.
Cause everytime you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers.
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us.
Lookin at us now calling us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us.
Nigga we started this gangsta shit.
And this the motherfucking thanks I get?
It's funny how time fly
I'm just having fun lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics

Hi baby
I know your under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you I feel you in my arms
I miss you.. I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much; that I'd do anything

I just wanna fuck bad bitches
All them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at 'cha boyfriend aint 'cha?
You'se a bad girl gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
 Yeah the bitch took the whole eight
and ran with it then let Mel-Man hit it
and Hitman hit it; damn bitches
Man this is what I'm talkin about
Chicken-head chicken-fed with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
 Next time you need a taste 



I just wanna fuuuuuck you
No touchin and rubbin gul you got a husband who
loves.. you..
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuuuuuck you
We can't be kissin and huggin gul you got a husband who
loves.. you..
You need to give him your quality time 


You got the number it's on you to make the call
You know I cum quick; help you re-decorate your walls
Cut your backyard don't have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm goin too far I take it out and wipe it off
and put it back up and keep going
You tryin to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin
that your pussy's been tampered with
Then you show him the new trick of how you can lick it smoke a cancer stick
You be workin it like a dancer bitch it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin diggin through some records instead
But tonight I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hookup somewhere and exchange some 
I know your man's lookin for ya he's always tryin to run ya
Don't worry bout me handcuffin gul cause I just wanna fuck witchu 


.. fuck witchu
On the sneak tip on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do ya freak bitch?
You actin like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin wit
Baby was a virgin that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennesey she gave me some head
I fucked her on the flo' so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' 1/2 Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Man she blowin up my pager the shit's gettin major
A favor for a favor this dick is what I gave her
Somethin to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out 
Twenty-fo' seven Dre Snoop and Devin
We servin' these hoes and never lovin these hoes lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics










Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E 
Still still doing that shit huh Dre?
Oh for sure check me out


It's still Dre Day nigga A.K. nigga
Before I chrome the lot can't keep it home a lot
'cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga My last album was 
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed they want to know how I feel about it


If you ain't up on pace


Dr. Dre is the name I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police 
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets repping 213
Still the beat bangs still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed still



I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets it's the D-R-E 

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well hell me and Snoop we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets signed Eminem
He's triple platinum doing 50 a week
Still I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed I smoke till I sleep
Wake up in the A.M. compose a beat
I bring the fire till you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke it's been tried I'm the troop
It's  from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it After-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
Swap meets sticky green and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin D-R-E



It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack play this track
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world

I'll break your neck damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back


So if you ain't up on thangs


Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs no more living hard
Barbeques every day driving fancy cars
Still gonna get mine regardless




Right back up in ya motherfucking ass
'95 plus four pennies
Add that shit up D-R-E right back on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog
No stress no seeds no stems no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky
Ooo Wee lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics










I got mo' class than most of em ran wit the best of em
Forgave the less of em and blazed at the rest of em
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-A
Where niggaz die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a baretta nigga I'm down for whateva
I roll wit my shit off safety - for niggaz that been hatin me lately 
and the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin gangsta rap shit down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E to D.O.C. to D.P.G.
started from that S.O.B. D.R.E.
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin pistol holdin
Pockets swoll nigga that's how I'm rollin
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure and a builder for real
I'm hittin switches makin bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres floor seats watchin The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases 

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 - Niggaz play this in they Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 - Bitches play this in they Benzes Jeeps and Geos



I bust a Mr. Toughy slash a Smoothy Doobie
Crash and flex on Tuesday's harassin hoes at movies
Passin by with uzis - and who you aimin at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin that
Rat-ta-tat-tat 

I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
tryin to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
like snitch niggaz in the pen that get
hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin HARD Hitman and Dre
You playin games I suggest you know the rules
We puttin guns to fools make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze Cabos
Pop coochie til the nut oozes you shouldn't fuck wit crews
that's sick Aftermath cause we rule shit
I'm Big Hit don't confuse me wit no other by the flow motherfucker 

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this lyrics

Xxplosive West coast shit
My nigguh-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causin me to yank they arm and pose like I would do the harm
Now I'm sayin thank you cause they tell me my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive.. ..for my niggaz drinkin Cognac smokin weed always pack
mo' than one firearm chrome rims ridin on
Chronic in yo' system let me know my shit's the bomb - Xxplosive..


West coast shit nigga
Overdosage - imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch; don't tease bitch strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch gobble the dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up!
Gobble and swallow a nut up shut up and get my cash
Backhanded pimpslapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar pimp convention hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush six-deuce impala
Pimpin hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggaz paid for hoes just to lay wit hoes
Relax one night and paid to stay wit hoes
Captain Save'Em all day  well save this dick
Bitch nigga you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hittin pussy or hittin the switch
You into hittin bitches off of the grip you punk bitch


All my real Doggs still kick it wit me
All my down hoes still trickin wit me
All the true gangstas know

All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checkin for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passin nuttin but dope indeed...
Real trees...

No seeds...

When I had you last night baby
Before - I blew yo' mind

No more - now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Hmmm-hmmmhmmmm...
Don't wanna treat you wrong

While we - still makin gangsta hits
You'll be - still jockin gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you slick
Somebody better get this biiitch this biiiitch


I got these freaky hoes
Clappin they hands stompin they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimpin bitches on the regular I put that on the G
A hustler and a player nowadays it pays to be
Lemme drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave ya boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro I had to grab the hoe
She got freaky in yo' sixty-fo' I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin the hoe for fo' days pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend I left them hoes at the mall
They be beepin me and shit but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiendin they on the nuts
But beitch I'm out ya pussy when I nut lyrics

(feat. Eminem Phish Xzibit)



 What's the difference between me and you? 


Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils got down to business; but sometimes
the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cuz you my nigga Doc and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef nigga I miss you and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin that they non-violent talkin like they *voice sample*
Spit venom in interviews speakin on reunions
Move units then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
Nigga it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference



What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin


Yo I stay wit it
While you try to perpetrate play wit it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it 
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
 Come and get it shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you 
A heartless bastard high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never cool down
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? 
About five bank accounts three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference




Aight hold up hold up!
STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say
Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
 I don't know if I ever told you this but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back just know this shit

 Riiight? .. Slim I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one nigga let's blow this bitch
 I mean it dawg you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?
 Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch I'll show you where the ocean is


Well that's cool and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people  Then drop her off on the corner
at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
and they nose and cough snot up mucus in hot water
That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream "I Just Don't Give a Fuck lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics








Damn girl it is hotter than a motherfucker up in here
You got that right

Hell yeah still 
Heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs that don't love hoes
and Firm Fiascoes - assholes
Fucked you up with my last video tuxed up
doin a tango..
And cash always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin khakis not kangols stranglin hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feed me mangoes the other lightin my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass 
Came home uptight ready to mash
like a gas pedal get on that sixty-four Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you tell me if you see devils
cause we rebels over here I smell Chronic in the air
that means we takin over this year
You hear? 

 Chronic two-thousand  - KRS-One
 That means we takin over this year ya hear? 


Light Speed blazin Chronic through the galaxy
Hydro doja chocolate thai weed
Or we might be sippin on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that where that new shit The Chronic Iced Teas 


I hang among hustlers I slang and hoo-bang Bronson
when bustaz roll through can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
cause gangbangin is the active activity
where I be livin B there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat don't let them catch you
slippin without yours it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance violent uproars
Trash niggaz takin out like chores I meet whores on tours
Jeans hot as pepper so I sip champagne on stormy shores
We on some hardcore pornographic
Totin Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings it be sounding like
Lebanon makin fools  like Megatron and Starscream
Oh yeah I scream-on-stars
to get loot and crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Get out your car son that's how I came to bougie niggaz
Act bad one it's either that or make front page stardom
I'm the Golden Child chased by Sodom
?? gots my bulletproof it's hard to shoot me you hear?

That means it's real fuckin hard to shoot me you hear?

Dr. Dre Lyrics










Ya'll know me still the same OG
But I been low key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese no deals and no G's no wheels and no keys
No boats no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me cause
I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho Please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and D.O.C's the Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said motherfuck the police?
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the doc that they told you to go see?
Ya'll better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flopped
ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck ya'll all of ya'll
If ya'll don't like me blow me
Ya'll are gonna keep fucking around with me
And turn me back to the old me


Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre


So what do you say to somebody you hate?
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of NWA.
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy give me an awkward eye 
And strangled him off in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out 
so from here on out it's the Chronic 2
Starting today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew

Slim shady hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Calling men ladies
Sorry Doc but I been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's OK go with him Hailie 




If it was up to me
You motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me
Like you want something free
When my last CD was out you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all
All them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all
Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What lyrics

With my jeans on and my team strong
Get my drink on and my smoke on
Then go home with something to poke on. What's up bitch?

When darkness be closin in
I'm motivated with the howlin wind
with a list of chosen men frozen in sin
Knowin that your end is beginnin
Swift silent and deadly
There's no defendin my plots I know your every movement
For six months I watch coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff 
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this here while I figure which way to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag take out the HK
Twist on the silencer insert the thirty-shot mag 
Bullet stuck to his brain like a mack
Skull in fragments I leave the cleanup to Dragnet 

This is anybody MURDERAHHH

Nigga all y'all MURDERAHHH

Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf think how I'ma just work
Give em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car put my steel to the side of his face
Murder - this the fuckin Case rob this nigga and shake
the fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now you crept on paid the piper
Who'da thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health shoulda learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me yeah you ballin
Was nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love but bitch niggaz die fast
Thug niggaz die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome slide back to the pad
and jack my nigga off til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit cause yo my man don't know

Aww they say uhh..
.. a black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
on planet motherfuckin Earth is her momma
It's her MOMMA that told her
"Get a man that got a good job gurl!
Make sure he got a good car gurl!
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!"
What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --
-- just cause you love the nigga?
But +I'm+ the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player! 

Biggest hoes on planet Earth..
.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
but you fucked him anyway!!!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
you went and got pregant - didn't you bitch DIDN'T YOU!!
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY
And then when the nigga ain't around what do you tell the child?
"Aww that nigga ain't shit that's why yo' daddy ain't here;
cause that nigga ain't shit."
How bout bein a woman and tellin the kid the truth
that yo' momma you was a hoe!
TELL THE KID!
Momma was a hoe I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga it didn't work out
that's why he ain't here - but he a good nigga
cause he take care of his REAL family
I was just a dumb bitch tryin to keep lyrics

Y'all niggaz gotta recognize yaknahmsayin?
Niggaz don't wanna peep game yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre droppin heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggaz connected all over the motherfuckin world nigga
Recognize this


Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd from the feet up
Blued up from the Zoo a pi' grew up
Loc'n smokin and drinkin til we threw up 
At Leimert Park taggin hittin fools up
Ditchin my class just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep y'all niggaz quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I manuever dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin [King T starts speakin indecipherable]


I'm comin  with a loose cannon
Smoke big green call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks I pop lock witcha
Picture this Dr. Dre twistin with Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick 
Wait a minute it's on I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold seperate check it
From sundown to sunup - clown done run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut nigga what?

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al Kokane]
We roll deep smoke on weed drink and back heat
Requirements for survival each day - in L.A.!
It don't stop we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way - in L.A.!


Gimme that mic fool it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes that's true
But I grew up where niggaz jack you harass you
Blast you for that set you claim 
Mash on you for your turkish chain C.K. B.K.
Blued up or flame I ran with a gang
I helped niggaz get jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? 
I bang though like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali AK's and 9's
One-time's sunshines and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian thai drive-by six-fo's on switches


I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touchin mine you catch a flatline dead on the floor
Better than yours drivin away gettin head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply we don't die the streets don't lie
What so neither do I I'm bad for your health
Like puttin a pistol up to your face and blastin yourself


Five in the mornin burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggaz who by fifths by the fo'
And bruise by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style lyrics

Now this this is one of them occasions
where the homies not doin it right
I mean he found him a hoe that he like
But you can't make a hoe a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
a bitch is a bitch but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what you found you a hoe that you like
But you can't make a hoe a housewife  


I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker she got paper she bout to trip
 I cannot G guilty
You pimpin strong but comin home to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy I take advantage
All up in them panties I got this bitch speakin Spanish
I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm bout to nut and get up go scrub yo' cat
Learn the player rules this is how I play a dude
Might not be a freak but she got on the choosin shoes
Dollar signs are folded I can't control it
Tryin to leave her beeper just exploded
She sweatin me won't let me broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh got her turnin tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin
I left her up in Dallas Texas - assed-out 




Naw hoe is short for honey almost had her Wailin like Bunny
Tellin tales of bein pregnant catchin Norstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef he caught up in the hoe's erotica
Exotic - she's psychotic rockin his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics 
Name a sexual disease she got it like Sam Goody
You be like 
Fool I pity ya
We live in the city off ballers
with more bouncin than a Zapp she will doo-wah-diddy-ya
Prettier to grittier the wittier can get her
to the Hotel Niko on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post hoe a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico 


At the ho-tel mo-tel or the Holiday Inn 
I said if that bitch keep fuckin up  then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip dive what can I say?
Niggaz need to stop fuckin with O.J.
Some niggaz bang blood some niggaz bang crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had to dream of hoes I had to scream at hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy I truly enjoy
if you blew my balls right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half nine-and-three-quarters
The hoe started callin when I started boss ballin
Gimme some head gimme some ass 
Gimme some cash pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop or pass it to Nate
Hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
That ain't shit new I thought you knew 
I knew you would you wish you could

It's fuckin ackrite
Question is - can I get some? Knahmsayin?
Ackrite bitch
When I see you in the spot you just ackrite youknahmsayin?
When I yank you by the fuckin perm
don't be lookin at a nigga crazy
Just get with the digits and be the fuck out youknahmsayin?
Let me break it down for y'all 

It was just one of those days
when I wanted to catch sunrays
Fun to get blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga ? got room grab the gat for misbehavors
and the chocolate faded boom flossin hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or end up clownin whores
Around the full good-to-go girls
like them ?? girls ridin shotgun baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sippin 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to the beach I'ma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson crack a smile
Cuties peep my style if I don't get some ackrite
I'ma have to ack-wild 



Blunt in my left hand drink in my right
Strap by my waistline cause niggaz don't fight
Sucker free for life so you better think twice

I'm the type of nigga playa haters don't like
Snatchin up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite right) 


Uhhhhh.. drink kickin in I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words I'M FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool til some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
plus we watchin hoes with lots of flesh exposed
gettin swarmed by those type of niggaz
with no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
"Yo is this your man?No."
Grab the bitch's hand 
Bling! Gold chain gleam

Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethern
I got mad spit flame on the name
Stefan tattooed on her arm
Hoe you ain't the bomb must be a dyke
witcho' lips swoll and give a nig' some ackrite 




Frontin on the ack-rite causin me to act up
Good Samaritan save that hoe from gettin slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks where else can we go to take hoes
from fake macks {*CAR HORN*} aiyyo chase them girls
in that black Maxima the passenger almost fractured her
neckbone lookin back at us
Plus they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush I bumrush the hush with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in
Mackin interrupted by some niggaz set-trippin
Clip in the strap lyrics

Niggaz still playa hatin but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
cause these niggaz is bangin ten times harder now
Niggaz ringin they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn they car around
Rollin the window down 

Johnny got a shotgun
and he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck tryin to job hunt
Niggaz got AK's niggaz is way crazier
than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin
Niggaz walk by and blast without leavin a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always tryin to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat some get blew out and every light
put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner Cali niggaz are dumpin
You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Makin death not so foreign to ya
Niggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough 
ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin
Ain't no warm welcomings my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep and fireworks until dawn 

Everywhere I go all I ever seem to hear is
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!
No matter where I go all I ever seem to see is

Now tell me - what the fuck is this man?
Niggaz doin brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand in front of your buildin and chill
without yieldin twelve-year-old children that kill
blood spillin thugs be illin unnecessary slugs
fillin the sky usually drillin the one
that wasn't willin to die yes sir in the Killing Field
I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder these niggaz got the nerve to
question me - bout the colors that I got on?
Now see that red dot on your knot
Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune I'm the wrong nigga to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on
my hitlist -- peep this
I cock back you bow down
Bust round bloody the ground retaliation sounds like this

A message to God

Since you finishin em early what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
you coulda forgave him you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded - wonderin why
Cryin pourin out my heart pourin out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers somethin we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watchin him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein him leave or watchin him go 


Listen listen listen..  whoahh

Youse a soldier you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug a son and a father
I spoke to your son the other day and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
cause I'm still paging you 911 straight in denial
Prayin you get it but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions from in shock to keepin a poker face
to straight breakin down and showin all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me but you know I'ma always ride wit you
I miss you sometimes I wish I just died wit you

Compton was the American dream. Sunny California with a palm tree in the front yard the camper the boat. Temptingly close to the Los Angeles ghetto in the 50's and 60's it became . Open housing paved the way as middle-class blacks flooded into the city. Whites don't buy houses in Compton anymore. Now with 74% of the population black power is the fact of life. From banks to bowling alleys. But the dream that many blacks thought they were buying has turned sour. Though the mayor and four out of five city councilmen are black they have been unable to solve the problems of crime and growing welfare which is slowing turning suburban Compton into an extension of the black innercity. Crime is now as high as the ghetto. 47 homicides last year gave Compton one of the highest per capital rates in the country. Juvenile gang activity muggings lyrics

I don't give one fuck
Off the top I wish a nigga would try a nigga
Real shit y'all counterfeit
Y'all niggas bad business
That's why the game all fucked up
Fuck Glocks I'm all about Fort Knox nigga
Ridin' through your neighborhood
Throwin' money out the window like 
You about the dollar 
Your poor life been without it
My life in the spotlight
Oh no no no I ain't even got to talk about it talk about it
Hol' up if you really 'bout it
Tell these mothafuckas we don't even wanna talk about it what?


I don't know everything but one thing one thing I do know
One thing one thing I do know (I know I know I know)
Is one day I'mma have everything
It was all a dream it was all a dream 


I just bought California
Them other states ain't far behind it either
I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper
Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers
I was getting money 'fore the internet
Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet
MVP shit this is where the trophies at
D-R-E yeah this is where the dope is at
The world ain't enough I want it all
Goddammit I'm too old I forgot I got it all
But Andre young enough to still get involved
And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all
Fuck you fuck you and you in the corner too
If you wanna beef make sure that that's somethin' you wanna do
There's some missin' people that felt that way too


I don't know everything but one thing one thing I do know
One thing one thing I do know (I know I know I know)
Is one day I'mma have everything
It was all a dream... It was all a dream... 


What the fuck was y'all thinking?
You let the wrong young nigga link with a legend
'Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records
I'm the only king here you can tell 'em that I said it
I'm the black Eminem I'm the humbler 50
I'm D.O.C. who do it better? Nobody fuckin' with me
I murder rappers everyday 'til police come and get me
And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio
Ain't no new rap in my ear too many depressed niggas
Emotional every song deserve to have breast niggas
Crying 'bout my old girl funny how I left niggas
Trying to get my ex boxed Red Ring of Death niggas
I'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chaining
If this was you your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising
I'm just talking reckless I'm just off the record
But I mean it kept my blessings
We was dreaming now we close enough to see it


I don't know everything but one thing one thing I do know
One thing one thing I do know (I know I know I know)
Is one day I'ma have everything
It was all a dream it was all a dream 


Listen I've been tryna get it all
I'm just in this bitch I'ma show 'em how to get involved
Yeah I want everything yeah I want everything
Talk about it hol' up if you really 'bout it
Tell these mothafuckas we don't even wanna talk about it lyrics

Stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9 all eyes on me
Murder murder
Murder murder
Call 9-1-1 emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder it's murder
Murder murder
Murder


My daddy done killed a bitch
Went and put that dome to her head
My daddy done killa you
Don't feel a pull a part that man and
 What it look like?
See my daddy done kill 'em dead
Bullets come down from the earth
My daddy done killa you
Don't feel a pull a part that man and
 What it look?


Stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9 all eyes on me
Murder murder

Call 9-1-1 emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder it's murder
Murder murder

Murderess murder listen hit a suburban whippin'
Tinted windows ride at your wifey  and I bet you miss her
Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand Scottie Pippen both ways
Been doin' drive-bys got this music industry timelined
Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's hot grinds
Shit Im just tryna get paid and keep em thighs high
Sometimes I feel like I could just bury em bury 'em
Cause delirium mass hysteria scarier area
I'm very aware that hip hop needed somethin' to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
Hangin' way too fuckin' close beware the barrier
This is hub city nigga don't make us embarrass you
Man you should be realistic these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic


Stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9 all eyes on me
Murder murder
Murder murder
Call 9-1-1 emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder it's murder
Murder murder
Murder


Ahh recognize whatever side the sides reside until the dead has risen
Live in a project building dodgin' the module ceilings
I ride I'mma ride in a stolen jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men my vision 
Mama tried counselin' five plans for Kendrick 
My family's ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence 
My aliens on surveillance they payed me a visit 
Our stadium's packed raiders in black
Curls drippin' silver bullet palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one way street
Nowhere to go death all I can see
I say  I fuck 'em up your supper's up or somethings up
I hoping all get orthotist rope it before the double dutch broke
Plenty ruckus with the weapon I protect it under oath
My discretion fuck your blessing fuck your life
Fuck your hope fuck your mama
Fuck your daddy fuck you dead homie
Fuck the world up when we came up that's Compton homie!

Murder murder
Murder
Murder
It's all murder
Murder

Murder murder

Family problems it ain't easy handling those needs

Baby mama drama I just need a little time to go to sleep
(Damn only if I had a little time for me)
Record company motherfuckers asking me when I'm gonna release
(I want the pressure homie so much pressure on me)
And my homies on my back about me helping them get up off them streets 


And it all falls back on me
Sometimes somehow it all falls back on me

No matter where we are no matter what we doing it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be



It's kind of funny how they fall back on me
I used to never get a call back homie
Before the money they didn't see me like it's dark and it's all black homie
But now they switching cause the card black homie
It wasn't always that way
We was recording on the 4-track homie
New apartment no fridge no mattress no table no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back homie
What it came to be would have never believed living the life I lived in C-P-T
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that homie


It was something to me
No eat no sleep wasn't nothing to me
Can't always be how you want it to be
And I'm the one that they looking up to
Fuck they expecting from me?


And it all falls back on me
Sometimes somehow it all falls back on me

No matter where we are no matter what we doing it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be


That's just the way it is and how it always was
DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love
Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggas start tripping and start shooting shit
On any given day I'm like 
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's  all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit
And was like 
Couldn't help myself just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in 
This one of those dreams you don't wake up from
Then again you don't sleep if you come from where I come from
When the sun shines and they bust nines
Don't dial 9 plus 1-1
When they run up on your school bus with a two truck you might learn something


And it all falls back on me
Sometimes somehow it all falls back on me

No matter where we are no matter what we doing lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics










Fear fear's a powerful thing. I mean it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy I had to just kill. And you know to a certain extent that's still with me in how I work you know I just... go in


Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up like what the fuck?
And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles
Lookin' like a villain layin' low
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up
Goin' up but shit I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault
Only type of livin' I know


See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
And they ask me how I do it
Mothafucka just take a look around
Best believe I'm in the buildin' I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but uh
No no don't mention me at all
Yeah comin' live and direct
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it but uh
Watch your mouth I dare your ass to say somethin'
I thought it was all good
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line
Kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame and though I gave everything to this game
They still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's so much fuckin' pressure
There's all this pressure
And it's all in a day's work


Work hard
Workin' so hard
24/7 3-6-5
365 hard work
It's all in a day's work


My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster
Shit I was still sayin' 
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong.. so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel like a Hilton sick and tired
Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate
These bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle it's all in a day's work
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse
They just thirst


Hard times
I'm on my grind fuck the part-time
Stay ready for war I'm on the front line
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
Only type of livin' I know
Only type of livin' I know
Only type of livin' I know
Only type of livin' I know

Gonna go to work
We gotta work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind back to work


Let's work
Rich as fuck but guess what I'm back to work
Overseas back home no time to sleep I'm back to work
So many people that I love they want my time but I got to work
Some of my friends don't understand I got to work
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like 
If you really wanna do it like this shit you better get back to work
Back to work
Right back to work
Gotta get back to work
Shit lyrics

Where you at? where you from?
What you doing over here motherfucker?
Whatchu think? what you bang?
This ain't your motherfuckin gang


Now I ain't never been no gangsta
But I know niggas know niggas from the darkside
There's some cold killas cold niggas
My nigga used to roll with us roll with us
Married to the more money more women
Now I ain't ever been the one to pull a gun on you
But you know who got 'em
No I never sell no drugs homie but I know who got 'em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me but I know who got 'em
If you die tonight you die tonight
Momma might cry to night if she find you high off the dynamite
But to you is just another Friday night
Got a nigga for the car tonight
With the bible right beside that pile of white
That's what this life is like



Now please don't give me a reason
Cause I know you wanna keep breathing this evening
I've been killing the game for seasons believe him
That I'm the motherfucking one to breed them and lead 'em
In a league my own you ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorised for this song
Might be best for you to get gone
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong in this song
I have tried my best to be calm
Please don't make me grab that phone
Now who you know who came this fucking far
From the fucking bottom?
30 years in this bitch and I'm still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing something right
Word to my nigga Eazy


Eazy-E CPT OG from the other side 
From the other side 




It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone


I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars LA has ever seen
People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though I've been this way since 17
Tryna get finances poppin' man I thought that was the object
To some of my niggas lost they life and then that goes the team
My only dream was holding us down like fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice I took this industry by storm young and black
Killing them softly don't ever call me fortunate
You don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me homie
We ain't even talking fuck that energy fuck up off me


It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone


You look at my lifestyle I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fuckin' with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit you can only get on an oversea flight now
You scare of my heist now
But still I got enemies giving me energy I wanna fight now
Subliminally sent to me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really no clue you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then you hang yourself
Cause I got the Beem in gold with a million sold

All my life I've been down to ride
Till I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and being between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life


You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where the niggas load clips and fats and get stabbed at home room should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit take your car for a test drive 
Gangbanin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life you never die you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

R.I.P to KMG
I'm still gonna murder and don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building I just give a fuck where the money at

They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays and if you get a train better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta y'all testin my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a capre


(Wait hold up I got next)

Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux oh you fucks guess what I'm ready to blow
(Yo oh no)
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors scrapin' bumpin' in the driveway
You gave me the pistol told me to kill at will
(Blow yo oh no)

Literally cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities

These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitches niggas from runnin' their mouth



One in the glove one in the clip one in the chamber
One on the dash one in the stash ready for danger
I'm ready to die I can't control this fuckin' anger
Ah shit somebody better fuckin' stop me
Cause I'm a loose cannon that can't stand myself I'm bad for my own health
You niggas really think I give a fuck about somebody else 
I swear to god I'ma do it back the fuck up I'ma do it I swear to god I'ma lose it

Baby baby
What the fuck are you doing? Put the gun down
Really? Are you doin' this shit to me again?

You is so fucked up for this

(Wait wait wait wait)
I'm sorry!
Don't point the fuckin' gun on me!
Okay put the fuckin' gun down!
No no no no!!

Alright I got her legs
Man this bitch is heavy
You gotta get under her armpits
Shut the fuck up I got it
What the what the fuck did you guys do?
It was this nigga
Me?
Shit matter of fact you know what you go dig the fuckin' hole this time
I don't give a fuck it will be the first fuckin' hole I ever dug
Who the fuck is that?
I don't know ask fuckin' Charles Manson right here
Oh oh you're tryin' to be funny? You're really fuckin' tryin' to be funny right now?
Shh shh shut your ass up
This is bad
This is this is fucking bad man
Fuck it lyrics

From close range we official
Cocaine money and pistols
Goddammit I got issues
Can't be serious
Alright now here we go
Where my city at?
Fuck with me come on
I know you're feelin' that
Fuck with me come on
You know I'm really that
Fuck with me come on
Come on come on
Don't even act like I ain't about my business
Mothafucka come on!
Come on come on
Full clip ammunition
You don't wanna deal with these fuckin' consequences


Fuckboys should tighten up a whole lot
I got some niggas with me down for runnin' up in your spot
And these niggas got hatchets and ratchets
Some of them lethals up under the mattress
And matter of fact this is a chance to show my lifestyle out to the masses
But chances are I might get another negative reaction
They got my fraction but I fucks 'em up like battery acid
Who gives a fuck what you think nigga? This is my passion
Ride through the time you know my name you know my reputation
You know what it is I don't need to give no explanation
When you say my fuckin' name add exclamation
Los Angeles king now make your bitch bring crowns
To me and Dre you don't like it you can lay
Think I'm quiet cause I'm actin' but my bank account gon' say
Fuck you! Respected from SoCal out to the Bay
Cashed a lot of checks this mornin' guess today was a good day


Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers'll join the fallen


But this is what the fuck is up doin' this for my city
Comp-town Hub this my fuckin' committee
Shout out to Dub C real nigga be with me
C-Walkin' on these niggas with a crease in them Dickies
You know how many nights I heard them sparks echo in the park?
Around this time I was spinnin' records at Eve After Dark
My CD crazy school girls used to play with that chalk
Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
You understand what I'm sayin'? Shit is crazy man
Fuck the money yo this shit could never change me man
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me man
I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day
Just havin' some fuckin' fun with this rap shit
Nigga with an attitude still gettin' active
Man this industry to me it feels a little plastic
I ain't heard nothin' that I can consider classic
But this is for my niggas who been runnin' with me
And everybody in this bitch that's out there gunnin' for me
And I got love for my people that stay one hundred with me
I'ma keep it A1 lyrics

What is going on in Compton I don't understand it?
Well as it relates to this this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre


I heard you talking about respect I gave you niggas the utmost 
All you niggas the utmost 
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder and tell him about his brush strokes?
Them opinions I don't trust those
I apologize the city made a niggas so cut-throat
Every hood love me but it started on one coast
Coulda stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go
Don't get it fucked up


Been away from home
Been away from home
All night long
(All they wanna know is
Where you from? Where you from?
Where you from nigga huh?
Compton)


Pst this is about round for them
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah down in the Pacific 
Where them sharks at nigga down in the deep water
Listen listen listen
All you niggas swimming in the info
Gonna fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard used to be my kinfolk
Now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes
(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes what the business?)
These niggas won't let up until they all wet up
Don't get it fucked up
Naw nigga now everybody wanna visit
Tryna re-up that prescription 
Yup yeah re-up
That's my nigga water colors couldn't even paint the picture
They don't get the picture fuck them
Yeah drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children

I'm the one that got they ear for many years
I been making parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear
My influence run deep like the ocean
Don't get it fucked up


Been away from home
Been away from home
All night long
(All they wanna know is
Where you from? Where you from?
Where you from nigga huh?
Compton)


Feel's like you're drowning don't you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
It's over shoulda never jumped in
If you can't swim (if you can't swim if you can't swim)
Oh my God where's a life guard when you need one?


Motherfucker know I started from the bottom vodka baby bottle
Mixin' up with Similac my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking about no rapping I was drinking for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No releasing me I got the beast in me
I gotta holla keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator energizer
Inner-city bullet fly 'til that bitch on auto pilot 
I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents house

Probably got fucked up tryna park his tour bus
Not knowing what's what
Or who's who living in the L.A county zoo
Pick them off like a big dog motherfucker woof
Once upon a time I shot a nigga on accident (boom boom boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom boom boom)
That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death but he's no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath inheriting the drama better than
A great white nigga this is life in my aquarium



Been away from home
Been away from home
All night long
(All they wanna know is
Where you from? Where you from?
Where you from nigga huh?
Compton)


This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah down in the Pacific
Where them sharks at
Nigga down in the deep water


Help me
Feels like you're drowning
I'm drowning
Help me
Help me help me
Somebody help me
(Shoulda never jumped in
If you if you can't swim)
Help me 
Help me help me help me
I can't I can't breathe
I can't wait help

God please please help me please
Please help me please help...
Please help lyrics

Guess who's back it ain't a fuckin' question
They know the name bow in the presence of a living legend
Fuck what you heard it's murda murda you gon' need protection
Some niggas blinded couldn't see so look for me to come and give direction
Who hold the crown it ain't no conversation
I'm bein' modest should be silent 'less you payin' homage remain the hottest
Niggas can't stop us that's just being honest
And makin' hits I never had problems much in that department
Don't get me started don't compare me to the newest nigga
For everyone of you there's a hundred more and I watch them come n' go
My track record ain't coincidental
And these verses is like hearses consistently killin' all with instrumentals
Tell me fuck what would ya'll do without me?!
Kill yourself or even think of something crazy 'bout me
I'm like Ali a fuckin' champ now watch me rope a dope
Just watch him choke cause everythin' I drop is dope
Now watch 'em all go up in smoke


I came here to raise hell I can't lie
One shot one kill it's real I ain't hired
Don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
And never get it fucked up I got shooters for hire
Cause you don't want it I have you like aye aye
Better back the fuck up over guns so I try
Now that weak shit will never slide I despise
You are now not in the presence of nice guys


Look what the fuck I was just chillin' in the cut
And no beginners only winners run amok you runners up
You funny fuck like twenty bucks I know your slut will let me fuck
I told my city  now look how high they hold me up
I'm Kobe clutch I hold my nuts till I was old enough to cuss
Was kissin' bitches after lunch now that's a muthafuckin' rush
So by highschool I was fuckin' niggas bitches on the hush
So no questions and no panties in a muthafuckin' must
It's the peoples rapper I ain't no rapper
I'm the rapture on the mornin' after
You lackin' passion you ain't bad you just a wack distraction
I can't relax cause I feel the magic smashin' Toni Braxton
Where your sisters at? Let's get it crackin' 
Look I was young I was broke
Had no hope so I wrote that's how I cope
I went hard with no results
New approach same truth
Just get ready aim shoot then get buried bang woof
So they better bring troops because...


I came here to raise hell I can't lie
One shot one kill it's real I ain't hired
You won't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
Never get it fucked up I got shooters for hire
Cause you don't want it I have you like aye aye
Better back the fuck up over guns so I try
Now that weak shit we'll never slide I despise
You are now not in the presence of nice guys


It's fuckin' murder baby
I'm tryna hurt 'em baby
I know you heard me baby
Feel like I'm goin' crazy
It's fuckin' murder baby
Run run run the cops almost got me
Another tear drop another fuckin' body
Uh uh uh another fuckin' body
Uh uh uh another body
Uh uh uh another body
Uh uh uh another body
Uh uh uh another fuckin' body lyrics

It's motherfuckin' Game time!


Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it that's how I remember it
Yeah dip into the liquor store .9 in my khaki's
Crips tryna get at me my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me
Been shot robbed stabbed chased home socked out
Jabbed by esse's cops degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas went into me dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs trippin' with Henessey got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface car chase tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama she'll tell you how a blood taste
Basket case still I'm back with Dre shit I never left
Run up in Beats 
Produced by a billionaire in this motherfucker
Still smoking Dre we need a ceiling in this motherfucker
Compton!
They're killing in this motherfucker
They're drilling in this motherfucker
Lock the door they're stealing in this motherfucker
No chains no reins this my home
Nigga this hub city no fly zone
Niggas pull out burners start breaking like turbo on ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean and the needles lay
And switchblades if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on the concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep
Cause I mob deep down that side street
I'm a west side rider  gats on collars
Don't hate me better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leaning on that bro hand
Flame dump like a co-tail with my name on it


Another day in Compton the thrill is high
Know somebody's watching but I don't know why
Feel the fire burning it touches the sky
Feeling coming at you I won't die tonight
So I get by I get by
I get by I get lyrics

Say what's up to the broke nigga at the rich party
Who the fuck let this nigga in?
Do I look like I give a fuck? Sorry
Looking at these hoes and they gold digger gorgeous tryna get me
I run game on a bitch one Mississippi two Mississippi
Flint nigga in the spot til they pop one and the cops come like 
Motherfuckers own a shotgun like a pop gun and they ready like yeah
Still a good nigga I'm a Northside nigga til I'm gone
Do it for the ones in the hood like Connor gon' put the city on
Fuck that shit nigga fuck that shit go
Live for my hood look this for my block
Ride for the hood gotta spit it like Pac
I ain't got shit but I still feel good
Nigga can't take what a nigga don't got
Go hard in the paint you can tell em post up
Homie in the hood like 
Your mans in the hood talking all that shit
When they ran up on him lil buddy froze up
All they be talkin' but ain't saying nothing
Niggas be talking that ain't what they want
Ain't no fake shit around here
Cause my nigga my city is really as real as the fuck
I be killing this and not giving a fuck
You laugh at a bitch she get hid in the trunk
You think this sound crazy that's how I grew up
So this for my people that's still in the cut


I said I want that need that
The root of all evil mayne (get it get it)
I said I want that need that
The root of all evil mayne


Said what's up to the nigga wearing all black at a white party
And I'm looking like I don't give a fuck
That's how I get down nigga sorry
And I'm looking like I don't play no games nah nigga don't try me
Been that nigga that's been spitting that
Paid dues like a motherfucking hobby
If you're on that bullshit nigga better fly that shit right by me
I came from the bottom of this bitch and made it out of that shit
And that's why we on top of this motherfucking world
Damn look at that body
She come along with the territories
Turn around move it for me bend it over end of story

Got a relationship with that money

Even though I know she knows she crazy
(Please just let it go seize no saving you)
Ride ride
Til the motherfucking wheels fall off in this bitch

But I'm never stopping my poppin'
(These numbers don't lie but your love is superficial
It's the simple shit you need to pay attention to)


Want that need that
Root of all evil mayne
I said I want that need that
Root of all evil mayne


It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money mayne
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money mayne


Want that need that
The root of all evil mayne get it get it

Cars expensive blow this action
True revealing
Satisfiction


Yeah I mean I listen to these rap records
Half the time I'm suspicious
You niggas sound so fictitious
Believe me I know the difference
I got some words for you niggas
You're the definition of 
Listen up I been where you're going three times and plus
Big houses cars jewelry bad bitches all around us
Motherfucker uh I seen it all and guess what
It's the  you feel me?


Oh yeah I see what you're saying
I know some niggas just like that
Frontin' ass niggas man really ain't got no bucks like that
Stuck like that its cool if you cool gettin' love like that
Flashin' down the Southside Raleigh
You'll be runnin' outta blunts like that
What I mean by that is
Why your name always in these rental records
Spendin' rent money gettin' that bottle service into your section
You leased your car leased your house leased your spouse
No she leavin' if you run outta paper
And might be smashin' your neighbor
I know you think you're a star cause followers clickin'
Guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition
Like sneaker shoppin' summer you niggas are fuckin' sickenin'
Cause you'll take your soul out just so you can fit in


Simple pleasures rockstar living
Drugs and mansions hit the ceiling
Cars expensive blow this action
True revealing

Cuz fuck wrong with these niggas
These labels always ask me to do a song with these niggas
Doc I think its time for you to open up the pharmacy nigga
And change this fuckin' music shit my nigga you should consider
Nah I'll be doin' me lokin keepin' these bad bitches open
And keeping them wet yep see cause Long Beach right by that ocean
Sippin' that gin and juice my nigga yep I'm still on that potion
All these random niggas fake as fuck and I'm stil gettin' noticed
God damn man how we s'posed to handle this shit cuh
Everything we done built these niggas dismantled this shit cuh
We gotta get back to that real that's on the dub
Another lesson from your uncle Snoop what what what?


(I'm just stating the facts
Don't get no realer than that
Satisfiction attention listen play your position player)
Shouldn't be too hard my nigga
Supposed to be like a lay up
It shouldn't be so hard to be yourself
My nigga wake up
Stay up pay up straight up cake up
Thats what I'm made of high? Yup
My life is all authentic that's why I'm goin' way up
Your satisfaction is fictitious your happiness is made up

These old sneakers faded blue jeans
No tricks no gimmicks I be stomping down down down down down demons
Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree the upper class hate
Middle don't exist the bottom of the beat glad I got my sticks
Are you jumping on a fad laying in a ditch
I be stomping down demons stomping down quick come on


The police don't come around these parts
They tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up come on


Bullets still ringing blood on the cement
Black folks grieving headlines reading
Tryna pay it no mind you just living your life
Everyone is a witness everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight
Got a son of my own look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight


Damn why the fuck are they after me?
Maybe cause I'm a bastard
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally
Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I know this is bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switch blade
Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid 
But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid 
Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents
Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling 
We need a little bit of payback
Don't treat me like an animal cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around cause when it's done it's done



And the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay
And the white folks tell me all the looting and the shooting's insane
But you don't know our pain


The police don't come around these parts
They tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up come on
The police don't come around these parts
They tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up come on


These old sneakers faded blue jeans
No tricks no gimmicks I be stomping down down down down down demons
Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree the upper class hate
Middle don't exist the bottom of the beat glad I got my sticks
Are you jumping on a fad laying in a ditch
I be stomping down demons stomping down quick come on


And the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay

Doc doc you gotta give us some good news
(Yeah about that...)


Don't let me find out the bitch in you
Don't let me find out the snitch in you


Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two of these
In the morning
Overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders


Listen this is my evaluation
This shit over saturated y'all can get evacuated
Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the internet stuck in place salivating
Ain't nobody graduating
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame that ain't no exaggeration
Damn I'm getting aggravated fuck I'm getting agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages
Somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?
These niggas in tight shit I'm in the fucking Matrix
It's looking like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients man how come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money why?
When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love for the love not
They gon' find out who you are just admit 'fore you get admitted


Say what you living about
Fuck you gon' tell me
Do you remember how you started out though
You looking lost now
(You want a pass oh damn)
Fake it 'til you make it
Take your little paper book
When you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not
That's word to doc


Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two of these
In the morning
Overdose
And kill yourself


In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem
I was this good scoffed I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended see how plain it was now they want me to jet
No one really gave a fuck about my descent 'till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall I just follow the 
So I rose and grew balls told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon the drama setter
I'm going in already got an arm and head
And whoever said words are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'm a go for mine
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
I'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign been a 
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one set with the blasters give me the orders I spray uh
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something
Dre make the bass bump and let the tape run for old time's sake
I spit it straight through this is take one
The moment you're waiting for has come but...


Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two of these in
The morning overdose lyrics

I just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute
While I talk about the pages of my diary
Listen up

I remember when I got started my intention was to win
But a lot of shit changed since then
Some more friends became enemies in the quest of victory
But I made a vow never let this shit get to me
I let it pass so I consider that part of my history
And I'm strong; financially physically
Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level
And don't forget that I came from the ghetto
Sold a new house for my moms that's special
I let you going shopping till your feet get tired
Then a new Benz just for you to ride in
When I didn't have it you provided
Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise
And my house got a view of the city like a highrise
I'm just talking to my diary I'm just talking to my diary

When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen no lines on the paper
I'm just I'm just I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just I'm just I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just I'm just I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just I'm just I'm just talking to my diary

Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks
I remember how it used to be
Now my money like NASDAQ my checks you can cash that
I remember how it used to be

I used to be a starving artist so I would never starve an artist
This is my passion it's where my heart is
It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed
Like the nigga I started with
I know Eazy can see me now looking down through the clouds
And regardless I know my nigga still proud
It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks
We used to sit back laugh and joke
Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters
You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing
Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella
Damn I miss that
Shit a nigga having flashbacks

When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen no lines on the paper
I'm just I'm just I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just I'm just I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just I'm just I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just I'm just lyrics

Niggers that I used to know and sell dope wit'
Listen to how a motherfucker flow shit
And let me know what's up and they can blast on
Thinkin' about the homeys that passed on.
Death Row come to show you all the game at
And show you how my label got the name that
So many wanna see me and time is money
But never in the P-E-N yo.
Welcome back to Viet Nam California.
Ain't a damn thing changed so let me warn you.
Every motherfuckin minute you on the West Side
The best side 20 niggers that just died.
Walkin' down the streets of L.A.
Stay strapped cause niggas bust caps every day yo
The 1-8-7 don't stop on undercover cops
So on this spot gettin' popped shot
Droppin' like this and like that
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peelin' back.
So creep when you in the C-P-T.
You catch heat from fuckin' with' the D-R-E.
I got my eyes on the shit unfolding.
And there ain't gonna be no trippin'
Cause they know the type of shit that I be holding.
If there's another word said
I'll let my forty-fo' go buck to the head nigga. 



Yeah and you don't stop 
Yeah and you don't stop  



3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1
Head away sent away get away Snoop's got a gun
And he's lookin' for the cops who set him up in '86
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix.
Back on the streets with my khakis and my scars
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar.
Scared as a motherfucker cause I'm fresh out
But I got to make my green and plus they all fiend
Follow me they keep yellin' murder but it won't stop
Until the last nigga that you know drop.
Another nigga out but I doubt that you really give a fuck what it's about.
Now 99 pigs on a block with me
Not a motherfuckin' cop wanna knock with me
A C-O-N-V-I-C-T the motherfuckin' D-O-G comin' from the L-B-C.
Look at what the doc brought in
A chrome 38 a Fo'ty-fo' mag and mack 10
So what you wanna do? 
I got the gauge a uzi and the mothafuckin 22
so if you wanna blast nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!" 



Yeah and you don't stop 
Yeah and you don't stop  



Splat to a motherfucker face he fall.
Strong motherfucker cause he starts to crawl.
I guess I gots to load the glock again.
Hit 'im with the hollow points and watch him spin.
Fuck it I had to do this quick.
Grabbed the glock 17 the clip went click.
Tried to detect but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass pops him and drops him.
That ought to stop from beatin' up blacks
Dead in his tracks from a full six pack.
Relax cause I'm about to take my respect.
I aimed the twelve gauge straight for his neck.
Boo-yaa! Boo-yaa! then I fade into the wind.
1-8-7 and it's on again.
Well it's on and it's on and it's on and it's on
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome
And it's on and it's on and it's on and it's on
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome.
Fuck 'em buck 'em if they really wanna trip
Niggas keep your hands on your motherfuckin' shit.

Tonight we're gonna get badder 
You're gonna get wetter 
We gon' take our time
Not tomorrow no tonight we'll love
(Fuckin' like we in love we be fuckin' like we in love)


Yeah she got that shit that make you kill a nigga
Crack that last bottle I'll kill it wit' you
Pour my feelings out and spill it wit' you
That's a no-no but what he don't know
Never hurt him so just desert him
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave
No I'm kiddin' I'm knowin' my dick is different
He kept his distance I kept comin' over and stayed persistent
You bitin' your lips toes twitchin' and she crinchin'
Steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me even your mama
But you said you'd deal with the consequence even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated wit' honors your probably hate that I'm honest
But fuck it I'm goin' all out
You should too good things don't last forever I thought you knew


Tonight we're gonna get badder 
You're gonna get wetter 
We gon' take our time
Not tomorrow no tonight we'll love
(Fuckin' like we in love we be fuckin' like we in love)

Now don't you no worry 'bout that
Whatever you want I'm on that
So don't hesitate girl when you lonely
Baby don't worry we know that I got you


Now here we go again from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lyin' and changin' places
You might've been I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean the swagger I got just know it's half the effort
They tryin' to toot my horn
But shit I sworn that I swarmed up in it stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passin' up 'til we finish
What we started you wit' it? I'm wit' it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hopin' you come to grips at least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fuckin' you on the chair



Know that I got you 'bout they thinkin' out you
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that
Ow we in a phase oh I can't wait
Cause waters don't label you oh no no
I'm from came from the bottom so just get on top of that
How 'bout wit' the top back wit' your top back?
Take that uh ooh ooh break that off more lyrics

How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question nigga
How many niggaz can I blast on sight? 



I'm ferocious and you knows this nigga
Bitches wear skirts shake ass and bump
I pop pistols that's all I do
I pop one at him and pop two at you
I'm illusive I'ma glock it
Pistol popping activist with the key to the bucket
I rip your pockets of the side of your pants
You glare to the side and you glance I'm in my G-Boy stance
How the fuck you make it this far?
No matter where you at or who you are
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hear ooh's and aah's when I jumps in my car
Just from last night you can tell
that I'm addicted to the fast life
Shouts out to my homeboys Mad and Quell
You go on and fuck Misty while I fuck Michelle 



Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question
How many niggaz can I blast on sight?
Just ask yourself the question
 or is it cool to fuck?
Just ask yourself the question
I don't know why these motherfuckers wanna fuck with us 



What you wanna do penetrate me?
Bump my crib? Bust and fuck my bitch nigga?
I never thought a nigga would trip
off a little piece of ass that he know he could get
Any day  and any time 
You'se a vegetarian  I like beef turkey and pork
Fish and chips chips and dip
Fuck it hand me my knife and my fork
I'm not too picky nigga Kurupt young Gotti
A.K.A. Low Ricky nigga 
Substantialar tyrannosaurus gigantic titanic tarantula.
On a creep homie wake up
Don't sleep homie supposed to know it
Look I'm hazardous to health nigga bitch nigga
Don't ask me shit 'till you ask yourself 



Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question
How many niggaz can I blast on sight?
Just ask yourself the question
 or is it cool to fuck?
Just ask yourself the question
I don't know why these motherfuckers wanna fuck with us 



What the fuck is up? Man life's a bitch
You gotta put your pistol to the sky
kill a million motherfuckers and get high in order to be cool
Man you'se a motherfucking fool 
I thought the same way back in the days
Young with a lack on daily things
Never thought too much homie never trip
I got drunk as fuck the homies blaze sticks
Look out for them niggaz out to catch us
So I'ma stay forgetting to tank your pistol with you 
Niggaz get swallowed in the game
I cock and bust hollows to peer duck and frame
Yo nigga that shit sounds like I did it
Don't blaze the ??? without the top bullet
Niggaz look like they're doped up like tired bitches
With the eyes wide gone you spit the hard boom
Wiping shit the fuck out like typhoons
With the little homeboys T-bone and cartoons
Motherfucker don't ask me for shit
Fuck everything you believe in little bitch 



Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question
How many niggaz can I blast on sight?
Just ask yourself the question
 or is it cool to fuck?
Just ask yourself the question
I don't know why these motherfuckers wanna fuck with us 

What lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics





(feat. Justus Victoria MonetT.I. & Sly Piper)




They've been wondering if I'm gonna show
Shit you already know-ow-ow-ow
Where you been? where you at? where you headed?
This shit started to disappear oh no no
I'm right here yeah take this shit right back to the basics
Sound like I'm right back in the basement
Tryna to put my neighborhood on
Six in the morning six in the morning
Until six in the morning best believe I'm on it
Man I'm working so hard
When the check hit the bank shit I ain't even notice
I live in the future I'm blind to the moment
I I you ain't gotta stay
Oh you ain't gotta stay around we own it


I remember when I was young just a front runner
I was fucking with them drums like every summer
Homie couldn't make it out the hood make a nigga wonder
But I couldn't let Compton take a nigga under
No way no how can't stop
Had bigger dreams for this hip-hop
I'm happy it was music and not Ziplocs
And now we bringing crowds like it's woodstock
I might as well wipe down the crown I done put up in the attic
I don't play around lotta niggas coming through the door
Not too many stay around
Lot of artists made it yeah
God damn man I made a sound
Oh you ain't never seen a legend do it?
Hold up homie wait around
I've been on the verge since a nigga put it down
If we talking numbers fuck Billboard charts
Putting for start with the bank accounts


I've been away
But I think I'm doing better
Anything you do can't impress us
I won't let up on it
What are you gonna say
And I think because they hate us
And the fact that they can't break us
I will never let up
I'm going yeah I'm going
Best believe I'm going
I'm going back
It's time to get back to business


This shit realer than rap
Somewhere trapped where you can find me at
Got thirteen in my strap
And I kick it do it with me whatever town we at
I'm killing these niggas was never feeling these niggas
Went from a million to ten figures I grow
Getting back to the business in the back of a Bentley
I'm thinking damn how far can I go
Well if my nigga Dre can get a bill
It let me know that there's hope for a nigga still
And many more showing love for my art form
When the ATL the trap shit was on board
Give a raw nigga money when they let me in
If it wasn't for me they would have let me sit
Explanation for all the demolition we did
I'm grinding handling my business nigga


How many miles in the air
One million I'm stacking up this paper
Up up and away-er
One way ticket to the ozone layer
Don't you wanna roll where there ain't no head room
Take it to another atmosphere


Smoke this smoke this
Roll it up roll it up get a lighter
Smoke this
Roll it up roll it up get a lighter
Another atmosphere
I can change your atmosphere
Get a girl for my Johnson
Roll it up smoke this
Break it down roll it up get a lighter
Smoke this roll it up lyrics

Put your cups up get your smoke in
Baby we partyin ain't nobody loc'n

Take a look around it's pimp shit goin down
It's a lot of bitches a whole lot of freaks
Top notch hoes they flock in every week
What you wan' do get your next thrill
Take an X pill how the sex feel?
Damn you lookin good all ten of y'all
Wwanna roll  I'm dickin y'all
Keep your face down  keep your ass up 
You know what your doin  keep that shit movin 
Keep them titties jumpin keep the Henny comin
Every bitch in here need to be touchin somethin
I know they like it hot that's why I keep it hot
So how the fuck could they not want a piece of Doc?


I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm just drinkin smokin straight west-coastin
Bitches puttin ass in motion pussy poppin sex promotin
Got a car? 
Got a blunt? 
That's your bitch? 
Really I don't...
All I really know your hoe wants to be with me and she ain't playin
And what I'm sayin 
And screams between the sheets

Soon as the door close
I make 'em curl toes they all wanna get chose
We never love y'all my niggas all macks
We sip a lot of Yak fuck and never call back
Pack women in the club until it's pitch black
Thugs on their block wonderin where their bitch at
Where you think nigga? She with the Aftermath
Called her house she ain't home she with Aftermath
No talkin fuck how your day go
You want dick  will bitch say so
Don't be shy now probably the best at it
They say a party ain't a party until the west at it
Gravitate to the Doc like it's automatic
Take your clothes off make me wanna grab it
Turn around with it make me wanna stab it 
Time to get it crackin show me them bad habits 



When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me
And what I'm sayin is she ain't playin 
And sleeps between the sheets

Yeah Aftermath Doc Dre 5-star surgeon general

California love! 

-California...knows how to party
California...knows how to party
In the citaaay of L.A.
In the citaaay of good ol' Watts
In the citaaay the city of Compton
We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin! 



Now let me welcome everybody to the wild wild west 
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest 
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat 
the state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens 
lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes 
ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me 
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to tha Bay 
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way 
Dre puttin it down for 
Californ-i-a


-Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it... 



Out on bail fresh outta jail California dreamin
Soon as I stepped on the scene I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
the life of a west side playa where cowards die
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies 
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide 
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrands
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam it's west side 
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say 
But give me that bomb beat from Dre 
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown 
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!


 now make it shake... 



[Outro: Dre 2Pac]

Tonight's the night I get in some shit 
Deep cover on the incognito tip.
Killin' motherfuckers if I have to 
Peelin' caps too cause you niggas know I'm comin' at you.
I guess thats part of the game
But I feel for the nigger who thinks he just gonna come and chance things
With the swiftness so get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business yo.
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigger maxin at the top.
I hope you get his ass before he drops.
Kingpin kickin back while his workers sling his rocks.
Coming up like a fat rat.
Big money big cars big body guards on his back.
So it's difficult to get him.
But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact with 
him.
Hit him like this and like that 
Let 'em know that I'll make it for a big fat dope sack
What is this pen? so let's rush it.
If you want to handle it tonight we'll discuss it 
On the nigga's time in the nigga's place
Take a strap just in case one of his boys recognise my face.
Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker
But I gives a fuck cause I'm going deep cover. 



Yeah and you don't stop 
Yeah and you don't stop 



Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
Maniac lunatic call 'em Snoop Eastwood
Kickin dust as I bust fuck peace
And the mothafuckin drug police
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop
Plot yeah that's what we's about to do
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre (whatup Snoop) yo I got the feelin
Tonight's the night like Betty Wright and I'm chillin
Killin feelin no remorse yeah
So lets go straight to the motherfuckin' source
And see what we can find
Crooked ass cops that be gettin niggaz a gang of times
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at 7:00 so whassup nigger?
What you wanna do? 
I got the gauge a uzi and the mothafuckin 22
so if you wanna blast nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!" 



Yeah and you don't stop 
Yeah and you don't stop  



Six fo' five was the time on the clock
When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot.
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up
Better not be cause if it is they're getting lit up.
Oh here they come from the back and they laxed.
I'm checkin for the gats they strap so whats up black?
Chill lets hit a deal 
if it aint up to what you feel then grab your steel.
Right so what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip.
Cause you can save that shit. Guess what they told me?
'We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey
We'll put you in a home and make your life plush
Oh yeah but you got to sell dope for us."
Hmmm let me think about it
Turned my back and grabbed my gat and guess what I told him before I shot 
it:
'If you don't quit yeah if you don't stop yeah I'm lettin' my gat pop'
Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop



Yeah and you don't stop 
Yeah lyrics

I sit into the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight


My life is like a highlight reel
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step pacin'
Don't know if I'll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre's in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I'm sick


I sit into the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours all night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight


It's on blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
They're soaring too high to meet my reputations in jep'
Yep face it the fans they've been upset yet patient lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics








 I got juice but I can't stop no ocean liner baby!
 I'm down with you baby I'm there
 Man don't miss this it's gonna be FABULOUS
...
 We ghetto fabulous baby
The best food drink and women that money can buy 



Every day of my life is off the ringer
That's guaranteed like a fistfight on Jerry Springer
I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava
so holla we all hustle for dollar dollars
From Sac to Houston New Orleans to D.C.
*girls laughing* to beep beep
Bangin catch me with a dimepiece next to me
My Body all over Your Body like LSG
Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor
Rookies askin us how to be a playa
Get in where you fit in and never get your ghetto pass revoked
No matter how much money you make
Stay true to the game loc guest list terror clothes
in jeans and tennis shoes breakin your strict dress codes
Spit lyrical bricks thirteen deep
so I can be richer than Master P sellin Ghetto D 



Ghetto fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this

We ghetto fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this

You ain't heard of me you ain't listenin hard enough
Started in Compton servin from a ice cream truck
Now ten years later whippin a custom Navigator
Steppin on your toes playa stuffin up your alligators
I'm ghetto like Newport cigarettes feel me
Boom bap and slap that ass silly
This is for the full time students slash part time strippers
And young niggaz clockin at least five figures
Some of us pro atheletes some of us rap over fat beats
Some of us hustle in the streets
Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle
 off a pocket full of singles huh
And it's all bueno musical mafia like Frank Sinatra
Pop a thirteen shot glock to make you Go See the Doctor
Ain't nuttin nice
From hood to hood love livin the lavish life 





Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS three ooh ooh
Playin number two Tekken zero to sixty
in six point seven seconds  hangin out the window
actin up chickenheads like 
Flexin the Rolex oyster perpetual thirty-five diamonds
across the face still eatin out foam cups and paper plates
We don't call it playa hatin in the nine-eight it's P.I.
That's pass intereference automatic first down
Want Juice like Tupac then Obey Your Thirst clown
Be in the PJ's in NY rockin DK

Now will there ever be a day that my niggas won't ride for me? For me?
Nah nah nah
And will there ever be a day that your bitch won't slide with me? Homie?
Nah nah nah
And will it ever be a day that your hands ain't up when a nigga on stage
I been rollin' up haze in the studio for days just to work for a wage
Now I'm on fuckin' paid in this mothafucka
Who got a hit just like this? And got heart and rich like this?
Never failed 20 years and he still got grip like this
And got kids with a super hot bitch like this
You spendin' time tryna get like this
I wrote a script like this I'm on some shit like...
I'm at home on the track nigga this my shit
Try to spit my clip you might get hit and divided

Uh kill shit I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it nigga

Gunfire gunfire nah nah nah
Run at yah run at yah nah nah nah
We come for yah come for yah nah nah nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat those our enemies
Mi got a few chains worth a hundred keys
Them say they waan ride mi say "Pussy please"
Pussy boy never worried me
My clips up on the streets
Nuh call the police pon me
A hundred keys in these streets
Pussy boy now I walk with weed

Uh kill shit I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it nigga

How you spell C.E.O.?
D.R.E. what a nigga dream he could try to be
Uh even though I'm from a place where
Niggas got TECs don't mean technology
Grew up 'round Blood niggas real camaraderie
Plus Crip niggas on the other side of me
But I'm the only nigga that I ever tried to be
Winner never sins you know these niggas tired of me
Not to it if you want crap shootin' in your home
Where a nigga came from my life changed
'Cause a nigga made hits while my homies flipped bricks
Lot of them ain't here can't complain
Tried to survive 9 to the 5
You ain't alive if you ain't not willin' to die
The lower the low the higher the high
Do or you don't you fall or you fly
I mean you ride or die nigga

Uh kill shit I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it nigga

Gunfire gunfire nah nah nah
Run at yah run at yah nah nah nah
We come for yah come for yah nah nah nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat those our enemies
Mi got a few chains worth a hundred keys
Them say they waan ride mi say "Pussy please"
Pussy boy never worried me

Nuh call the police pon me

Dr. Dre Lyrics





(feat. Eminem Skylar Grey)




I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life


I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it record it so that one day I could play it back
But I dont even know if I believe it when Im sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in every day it's just so grey and black
Hope I just need a ray of that 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for em they just say it's wack but they dont know what dope is
And I dont know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up breathed new life in me I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son demons fighting you its dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me but I'm outta options there's nothin' else I can do 'cause


I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life


It hurts when I see you struggle you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so Im puzzled 'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you dont believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like Im your leader you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me everyone at the fuckin' label let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre Im cryin' in this booth
You saved my life now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin' I need you come back for fucks sake 'cause


I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

(I need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life)


It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in yellow jump suit whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth told you mic smoke
Went through friends some of them I put on but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim fuck all you fair-weather friends all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots
And the crackers' ass little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math backwards producers I'm back bastards
One more CD and then Im packin' up my bags and as Im leavin'
Ill guarantee they scream "Dre dont leave us like that man!" 'cause


I'm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long Im runnin' outta time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor lyrics

(Hey you sittin over there) Say what?
 That's right
 Yeahhh...
(No time to funk around cause we gon....)
Funk you right on up
So get up get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck so call me Blackula
As I drain a niggaz jugular vein
and maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain
Just chill listen to the beats I spill
Keepin it real enables me to make another meal
Still niggaz run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggaz off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad nigga now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a Stealth bomber I cause drama
The enforcer music flows like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin 





One-two for the crew three-fo' for the dough
Five for the hoe six-seven-eight for Death Row
Mad niggaz about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect plus a check
Now I fin' to get into to my mental
will take care of this business I need to attend to cuz my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova runnin niggaz over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I kick plenty of ass so call me an astronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow niggaz know it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokesscreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin 





Debonairre with flair I scare wear and tear
without a care runnin shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician no competition
Sendin all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop N Go
Dre came to wax you so just call me Mop N Glow
Many tried to but just can't rock with
I'm 6-1 225 a pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin me are slim G
Cause I rock from summer til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho and so as I continue to flow
Cause yo I'm just a fly negro
So check the flavor that I'm bringin

Niggas put my face on the milk carton take the shit off
Cause I've been home with the kids instead of breaking shit off
I'm asthmatic aftermath-matic Dre want me in the booth
The room better be padded cause I'm Loko
Psychotic six hundred wide body
Lost a couple mill last year but why cry about it
Westside got a nigga back so I throw my dubs up
Never leave without my strap it's like that
Got palm tree's we comin' through on three's
The A-F-T-E-R-M-A-T-H nigga we got a army
Aftermath general one love to fifty
Aint seen him in a minute yo used to be my nigga yo
Money changed niggas but we the same niggas
Add fuel to the fire that makes the flame bigger
But sometimes ego's clash with dessert eagles
And I stayed loyal to the city where the weed grow

I gotta get the chronic the Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin like indo-nesia

Cuz my '4 on hit

now if your bitch in my shit it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide

Right back up in you it's the D-R-E
Witta ounce as we bounce thru the CPT
Diamond in the back gators on the wheels
This is strictly for my bitches now we're hittin in switches
Niggas gettin jealous cuz hos be on our dick
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
So the '4 won't blow

The Ghetto  


Wake up jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil' 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God I wonder can you save me?
I'm only eighteen so I'm a young buck
It's a ride if I don't scrap I'm gettin' stuck
But that's the life of G I guess
Ese's way deep shanked two in the chest
Best run cause brothers is droppin' quicker
Ugn too late damn down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls throwin' them dogs
Gettin' that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank
Cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime I gots to do my time 



We run game in the ghetto
We gets high in the ghetto
We gets shot in the ghetto
You might get stuck in the ghetto
Lil' Ghetto Boy 


Now I'm holdin' the dub sittin' on swoll
Twenty-seven years old up for parole stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I be makin' soon as I touch them streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast right?
But it ain't no thang to me
Cause now I'm what they call a loced ass O.G.
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga I'm bigger than you so whatcha wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sittin' behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get 
For tryin' to jack the little homies for they grip 




Somethin' for the real O.G.'s to get with
Some facts made our made
Now you runnin' but I'm played
Like every single day really doe
You know me I'm the smooth macadamian
Gamin'em for my homie
No need in be uncalm if you pack right
And learnin' just enough to keep your sack tight
Late nights I wonder what they get in for?
Early mornin' on the corners what they hittin' for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride Eastside's where they swerve now
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
Got crept on stepped on now they gone
I spent four years in the county
With nothin' but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
Cause when you're broke you break check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
Cause you's a hustlin' ass youngsta clockin' your grip 



Lil' Ghetto Boy 

That's the life of a G I guess
The ghetto 

That's the life of a G
That's the life of a G I guess
The ghetto 

That's the life of a G. The ghetto
That's the life of a G lyrics

Shit I'm tryna get ya high
You been sittin in the waitin room far too long
Too late for- ay ay you're far too gone

Like a punk full of bullshit
Nigga hell nah

Good thing I had a couple hundred tums layin around
Nigga dispenseries servin by the pound
Back in business bigger than we ever was
It's aftermath nigga you know you heard of us
We're leavin narcotics on every note
We just struttin the streets like when the levis broke 
I got the antidote

But it's hard to go back to that bullshit
And whatever's on the bar Dr is gonna push it

Red bottoms on a red head
Fake molly fair body
We get it popping when she at her best
Cause it's a party when she bout it
Shots dropping now she out her dress
And girls coming out the closet
A superstar on some private shit


Make a promise not to tell nobody
If she hot enough to get it well get it girl
You know what it is I don't get offended girl
Mmm mmm
Come and kick it with a player enjoy your world
You better open up let me hit it and join your world
Like the ceiling reveal it before I kill it
She tried to go and tell the city I loved her but no I didn't
Fuck nigga no I didn't get comfortable doe eye dipping
Then wonder what she was feeling
Her number does not exist in my phone lyrics

Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mindsate
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
BUCK BUCK Lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggaz get hauled off  haha barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin flesh  barrel two
Shoots your fuckin heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to reck mine
Fool it's your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitatin I ain't hesitatin
To put you in the funderal home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a boddy bag
Nobody iller
Than this graveyard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a Natural Born Killa 


Terror illistrates my era
Now I cant hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
 yeah what's up
It feels like I'm bustin a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm givin dirt naps
Comin with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps you never sleep
Cause evertime you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin nose
Ain't seen the sun in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever ever made a hoe stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your livin
I'm the unforgivin
Psycho drivin
Murdera
It's authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Scizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit 'em with a brick
And I'm dancin 


Mass Murderer Natural Born Killla
And I don't wanna die
I DON'T WANNA DIE
I DON'T WANNA
I DON'T WANNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DIE! 


I dont understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of Sireens
Terrified screams from the streams
Of Strycnine
Dumpin on any motherfucker tryin to trick mine
Cause motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dialate
IT'S SO MUCH PAIN
MIGRAINE
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal just like Nirvana 


Tic Toc
Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keepin niggaz in order
Makin there live shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter

Route to be out without a doubt

Hey yeah ya know what?
I like the players
No diggity no doubt
Play on play that
Play on play that
Yo Dre drop the verse


It's going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB collab creations Funk like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me straight up
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them ear-gasms with my mellow accent
Still moving his flavor with the homies Blackstreet & Teddy
The original rump shakers


Shorty get down good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10
I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win


I like the way you work it 
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it 
I got to bag it up 
I like the way you work it 
I got to bag it up 
I like the way you work it 
I got to bag it up


She's got class and style
Street knowledge buy the pound
Baby never act wild
very low key on the profile
Catching villains is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the word
spin's the verb
Lovers it curves
so freak what you heard

Rolling with the fatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day everyday
You're blowing my mind
maybe in time
Baby I can get you with my ride

Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads

Stay kickin' game with a capital 
Ask the peoples on my block I'm as real as can be
Word is born
Faking moves never been my thing
So Teddy pass the word to your  Chauncey

And show you how my label got the name that
So many wanna see me and time is money
But never in the P.E.N yo.
Welcome back to viet nam california.
Ain't a damn thing changed so let me warn you.
Every motherfuckin minute you on the west side
The best side 20 niggas that just died.
Walkin' down the streets of L.A
Stay strapped cause niggas bust caps every day yo
The 1.8.7 don't stop on undercover cops
So on this spot gettin' popped shot
Droppin' like this and like that
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peelin' back.
So creep when you in the C.P.T
You catch heat from fuckin' with' the D.R.E
I got my eyes on the shit unfolding.
And there ain't gonna be no trippin'
Cause they know the type of shit that I be holdin'
If there's another word said
I'll let my forty-fo' go buck to the head nigga.

Yeah and you don't stop
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop
Yeah and you don't stop
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop


3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1
Head away sent away get away snoop's got a gun
And he's lookin' for the cops who set him up in '86
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix.
Back on the streets with my khakis and my scars
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar.
Scared as a motherfucker cause I'm fresh out
But I got to make my green and plus they all fiend
Follow me they keep yellin' murder but it won't stop
Until the last nigga that you know drop.
Another nigga out but I doubt that you really give a fuck what it's about
Now 99 pigs on a block with me
Not a motherfuckin cop wanna knock with me
A C.O.N.V.I.C.T the motherfuckin D.O.G comin' from the L.B.C
Look at what the doc brought in
A chrome 38 a forty-fo' mag and mack 10
So what you wanna do? 
I got the gauge a uzi and the mothafuckin 22
So if you wanna blast nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!

Yeah and you don't stop
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop
Yeah and you don't stop
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop

Splat to a motherfucker face he fall.
Strong motherfucker cause he starts to crawl.
I guess I gots to load the glock again.
Hit 'em with the hollow points and watch him spin.
Fuck it I had to do this quick
Grabbed the glock 17 the clip went click.
Tried to detect but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass pops him and drops him.
That ought to stop from beatin' up blacks
Dead in his tracks from a full six pack.
Relax cause I'm about to take my respect.
I aimed the twelve gauge straight for his neck.
Boo-ka! Boo-ka! then I fade into the wind
1.8.7 and it's on again.
Well it's on and it's on and it's on and it's on
Fo'-fo' desert eagle to your motherfuckin dome
And it's on and it's on and it's on and it's on
Fo'-fo' desert eagle to your motherfuckin dome.
Fuck 'em buck 'em if they really wanna trip
Niggas keep your hands on your motherfuckin shit.

Yeah and you don't stop
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop
Yeah and you don't stop lyrics

hard as Bacardi smackin those yaddy-yacks and ducks keep quackin

under the heat the pressure from the one thats deffer
Egyptian ruler will call me cleo ro Nefertiti yes indeedi

came in the front but you be kicked through the back door
for tryin to step tryin to come incorrect
tryin to play the left tryin to start a mess

and alcohol back off all a yall up against the wall
spread em doggs go get em and
cuff em and stuff em cold shed em dont let em

Rock on witcha bad self RAGE!
Rock on witcha bad self....

(feat. Eminem Nas)




My motto is 
So why is my supply low?
Bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though
Ghetto idol I think but what do I know?
Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Dont act like I'm Hollywood when I prob'ly could
I don't polly
Mohammed Ali of rap I don't lolly gag
West Coast the home of the bodybag
The shotty the mag
Los Angeles where the party at?
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah Andre is back so have a cardiac
Started back with the black
Rated starter cap
Gangsta rap we practically fuckin' started that
Everyday with this game I'm gettin' smarter at
Sky's the limit so everytime I get on a track


Cause ladies when I shine. Nigga wish quick.
No startin Im the shootin kind. 
Front page all the time. You boys think sick but I aint got no roof on mine.
I drink Topless I live Topless. Like my girl is the game with her titties out.
I drink Topless I live Topless. Skys the limit Im paid to run the city now.


Ya skins ya traveling bag of your existence.
Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistenin.
Vivid on my skin how many continents
Ive visit then you could journey with me to different places by listenin. 
Shittin on em. Ya brutha got it covered we can slug it lyrics

Dr. Dre Lyrics










 God damn you didn't know so
well I can blast fast so freak an ill type of slow flow.
I'm hitting harder than Berry Boss so check the golden child
throwing it to your ear-hole got you going buck wild.
But truck-tracks rhymes all day breaking off niggaz proper
did dirt did West cause I clown coppers .
Do hip-hop rap compose 'em most I couldn't see me
mad advanced and my skills are all about the dollar bills.
From Pittsburgh to Cali dropping bombs like that
was on the D.L. with the squad so I couldn't hold it back.
Black I regulate I buzz a big gate figure
mobbing with the ill nigga with his finger on a bigger trigger.
Serving all  hitting sevens on the 
making do' eating shrimps locing with some real pimps .
So peep game best believe I love my peeps
that's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
.
So buck my sound I put it down for the underground
I got the women cause I'm slamming jamming.
Got it going on this time for this new producer to rise
so open your eyes I think you better recognize. 



Once again it's the man with the masterplan
they call him Sam and I  



I remember days on the blocks where I slang slung played punk cops
and mad props cause I ran with hard rocks .
From napalms to Uzi's I made G's 
them build up enough Luther by keys.
No gang affiliation yo I stood on my own to pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga I never had to pull the trigger .
I mack and on top and that I'm used to staying wicked with just 24-7
you can ask my ex-hooker.
But now I'm on some new improved shit
making hits stacking chips now everything's legitimate.
I flipped the scrip a long time ago on the five-o
when I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow .
Yes indeedy I wasn't greedy got my niggaz out the gutter
now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy.
Hip hop fanatic causing static in the industry
these whack creators I call 'em imitators .
Been trying to see me but see I'm unexplainetory
with the fame and glory that's why I gotta tell my story.
With no disguise a lot of niggaz despise
because I'm on an uprise so I think you better recognize. 



Once again it's the man with the masterplan
they call him Sam and I  
 



Well I'm back in the mix with a bottle of hennessy
so fire up a blunt let's have an end of the sanity.
Crazy shot outs giving pounds to all my niggaz
hitting all the hookers by the dozen cause they dig us .
Fuck what you've heard recognize what you be seeing
it's time to earn truth to the game human being.
I'm that little bass nigga trying to get mine fuck a nine
cause I'll incline with the mastermind.
I got my crew in my corner so I can't loose
cause I'm paying mad douze in this record biz I don't snooze.
And suckers be popping at those idiotic egosytible type of flimflam
I can't be faded Sam-am.
Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers
cause boys play with toys and scholars play with dollars.
I'm a mack of my own right plus my game is tight
baby get it right I ain't the one so take flight.
Bitches give my mad rep nothing but the brazen off tempo
thinking they can get my loot I never trip to knock the boots.
I gotta be wise when time to dip between the thies
all eyes on the price so I think you better recognize. 



Once again it's the man with the masterplan
they call him Sam and I  
Once again it's the man with the masterplan
