Yo what's goin on this is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness aight?
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada my mans from down South
You understand the #1 DJ in the South to be exact
You heard that at the VMA's you heard it wherever he goes
My man Smallz is out there down South
Same time reppin for Toronto Canada y'knahmean?
So this right here what you 'bout what you listenin to right NOW
is the official 
I call it the  mixtape
Cause I'm not perfect and I bet neither are you if you listenin
so you need to just accept what's THERE y'knahmean? But look
You need to just let this play out
from track one to track whatever however many I put on here
You need to just listen to this because look man
it's the first time Canadian down South my man Smallz
Your boy Drake you know what it is man
So just uhh lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Uh Yea Man Vo Back Again Like We Never Left Huh
Yea Man Im Sending This Out To Any Of My Girls Thats Different Man
Anybody Thats Special
You Know I Wanna Be Honest With You Women So Ima Start Off Like This


Uh Look I'm Bold From The Get Go
Go By The Title Of Drake
And Treating Me Like The Rest Is A Vital Mistake
I'm Hopin That Aint Nobody Else As Special As You
When I Say I've Been Disappointed Im Addressin A Few
I Finesse Then I Groove
While Most Of The 8 To 9's In My Past
Now Get A Rating Thats Less Than A 2
Its True I Been Talking To Aleshia Keisha And Nadia
And Shadia Had To Throw Peace Signs To A Lot Of Ya's
Payback To The Same Chicks From Way Back
Never Call Now They Wanna Be Where I Stays At
Now They Got The New Boy I'm Trying To Move Forward
And Pass Me Classy Something Like Drew Lord
A New Me Cool See I Never Get Around
If I Dont Change Now I Dont Think I'll Ever Settle Down
Even If I Gotta Travel A Bit
I'll Go Around The World And Back
Cuz I Know That Once I Have It Thats It And Uh



You Can't Just Love Me Like They Do

I Need Someone Special In You

I Know That Out There Theres A Few

See I've Been Searching I Don't What To Do

She Gotta Be Special

By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down

You Gotta Be Special

Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around

Gotta Be Special


A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be
Since A Young Dude The Flow Was Nasty Acidic
Ever Since The Demo Dog 
And Groupies Are Gettin Brave
Now They Ask Me For 
Rappers I Write Em A Verse
And Ask Me To Spit It
But I Pay No Mind Though
Cuz They Know I Know
Hard As These Niggas Working Man
They Wont Sign So
Drake And Vo Back
I Take It You Know That
You Take It Sitting Down
Or You Can Take It To Gold Black
And Since Drake Done Took It From Curls To Waves
Its Been Kind Of Like A Whirlwind Phase
I Mean I Had My Share Of Women
Now A Nigga Gettin Girls For Days
With Most Of Em Its Seemin Like They World Is Staged
But From Georgia To Bk And All Around The World
Get Your Hands In The Air If Your Avoiding The Cliche
If You've Been Hurt And You Alone Be Steady
These The Same Dudes From Rewind Grown And Ready And Uh



You Can Just Love Me Like They Do

I Need Someone Special In You

I Know That Out There Theres A Few

See I've Been Searching I Dont Know What To Do

Can You Help Me?

Special

By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down

Gotta Be Special

Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around
Special


A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be
Look Theres Requirements To Be An Admirer
Still The New Version Of Fresh Needa A Nia Or Tyra
So We Can Be Jenny And Swayze
I Told You I'm Careful With My Heart Girl Many Have Played Me
Or Maybe Its Karma
They Say Is A Charmer
Halfway To A Night So I Stay In A Armor
I'm Fire On The Move
A Tire Looking Smooth
I'm Not Perfect But I Got A Desire To Improve
I'm Special
Like Kids In A Graduating Class
Having More Trouble Than Others When Addin Basic Math
Need You To Be Special Like Areba To Cootmore
Double O Top Secret Agents With Suits On
Something So Deep It Da Drown Me
Friends Are Some Cool Dudes
I Vouch For The People Around Me
On Your End Its Simple
All You Have To Do
Is Give Me No Reason For Other Lovers After You And Uh



You Can't Just Love Me Like They Do
(Yea; And You A Legend For Real Ima Give You That Man)
I Need Someone Special In You

I Know That Out There Theres A Few

Drake Lyrics









Stance on lean leg up on the wall
My people they chill why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh do what you do what you I do what I do
Do's what you do I do what I do


Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of rappers in my city they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride I'mma let those stay
So these nosy niggas won't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying on guessing
My record ain't even finish they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit
Both of the deals nothing under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro I'mma teach you beginners
Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner
Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her




Check the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me for your sake might wanna return it
Cause if you bring them discs home to ya girl she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is you just notice me now
But I was here along your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed  and I write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash
And purchase so fast you only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne
My pain you can experience through the rhyming boy




Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is something that the rest regret
Then I lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Southern Smoke {echo}
It's Southern Smoke baby!
 Frank 
 My man Nickelus F
 Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
 This is the remix right here
 So if you got some 
Put ya hands in the air
 Southern Smoke


Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga make sure you don't get shelled
 Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse boy!


I take time arrange that 
Some kill just to claim that 
Switch countries exchange that 
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my proceeds and cash right 
There's no need to stash right 
Got the same 4 g's from last night 
You cannot take that from meeeee homie

Drake Lyrics










Yo I wake up every morning shower gather my belongings
Yo I wake up every morning shower gather my belongings
Head to works I get some breakfast 'cause still a nigga yawning
From the night before at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?

Yo I wake up every morning shower gather my belongings
Head to works I get some breakfast 'cause still a nigga yawning
From the night before at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many 
Either I need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire need a choir 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP
We in the race to fame blowin' pass the PIT STOPS
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay put it in the heart of Pickering
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap anthrax it make ya sick huh
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh



It ain't as easy as it looks we go through some shit
You cut us a check then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM


Ayo I stay up every evening write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it they approach me and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo' at the club fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane 
Hundred grand Nickle F that nigga's the next to win
Virgina go rep for him and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree Tennekey T Dot to the country ya'll
Orangemen and White Haven an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed my city ain't on the map
 Light that fire realize they ain't born to rap
 Pass the torch and sell they soul 
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that
Cause I'm on set make it work break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins they paint they  to get respect
This can't be life dominoes and  dro and twenty stacks


Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!


It ain't as easy as it looks we go through some shit
You cut us a check then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp lyrics

Drake Lyrics









This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice just got clean rap
Don't ever two step I just rock lean snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular ? they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game in the city that I claim


Yo the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up range rove yo chick wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna 
Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go!
Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go!


Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama get it how you live that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny that's when you dip dip
And it's a trip my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface uh
Ya boy say this that and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence come into your yard and collect lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year money like a cashier so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine shine
And I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line line
And I got way too much love for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me I deport 'em the city is mine boy


Yo the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up range rove yo chick wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna 
Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go!
Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go!

Break it down break it break it down
Break it down break it break it down
Break it down break it break it down
Break it down lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Lady You Say I Stay In The House Til Four
We Dont Even Go Out No More
Its Always The Same Eh
Always Complainin
Its Obvious Baby
I Guess You Dont Watch The News
You See Theres A Lot To Lose
Cuz We Got A Baby
And People Are Shady


My Generation Is Changin
Aside From The Fact
The Dealers Have Customers They Provide With The Crack
Front Of The Buses Taken
And We Denied From The Back
You Can Die Where From Or Die Where You At


Don't Put It Past Them
I Dont Think That They Understood
My Friends They Dont Even Sit In The Class When They Should
He Can Come Pick You Up
If Your Dads In The Hood
Not Bad Meaning Bad But Bad Meaning Good Good Good


Lady Somebody Shot Up The Place Right By
Where I Work And I Think They Might
Be Coming For Me Next
Lend Me Ya Kleenex
I'm Tellin You Baby
I Think I'm A Bout To Cry
Still Gotta Go Out Tonight
Cuz I Gotta Feed You
I Hope That I See You Again... Again
Hope That I See You See You


Don't Put It Past Them
I Dont Think That They Understood
My Friends They Dont Even Sit In The Class When They Should
He Can Come Pick You Up
If Your Dads In The Hood
Not Bad Meaning Bad But Bad Meaning Good Good Good


Lately I Dont Know About The Friends That I Hang With
Im Nervous Round My Boys It Depends On Their Anguish
Depends On If They Saving All The Tops On Pepsi
With Dreams Of Seeing Girls Topless On Jet Skis
Depends On What They Do To Achieve That
Robbing R&B Singers 'specially If They Know Where The Keys At
'specially If They Know Where They Girl Live
Get The Info Leave With Ya Money Man Thats How The World Is

Thats How Niggas Puttin They Dirt Down
Streets Are Seedy I Call Em Sesame... Berkstown
'specially When These Young'ns Get Turned Down For Work Opportunities
Next Week Same Place'll Get Burnt Down
Coincidink? Not Likely Not A Chance
How Can We Be So Aware Of These Problems And Not Advance?
At Least Start Put A Bid In Its Hard Just To Fit In
A Lot Of People Only Play They Part When They Spittin
But I Dont Think That They Understood
They Using This Darkness For Penetration In The Hood
I Took The Ivory Way In And Yes Im Glad That Keenan Could
Not Bad Meaning Bad But Bad Meaning Good Good Good

Not Bad Meaning Bad But Bad Meaning Good
Not Bad Meaning Bad lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone 


Look
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin
Because They Swimmin In Women
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors
They Come In Secret Flavors
Thats Why I Envy Omar
Because So Far

And Thats Some Higher Learning
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot
With The Tires Burnin
And Im A Liar Turnin 19 Jaded With No Faith
In Any Female Thats Askin What I Was Earnin
I Met This Recent Lady
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me
Its Like Im Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy
Now Im Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately
Im All Alone I Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh


Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone


Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces
Circling Workplaces
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is
They Get To First Bases
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin
He Wanna Know What The First Trace Is
Now You Like Macgyver
Cuz You Sneakin Around
And She Dont Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her
I Cant Relate To That
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact

I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It
With  And They Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In
And In The End I Listen But I Dont See Me As They Do
Cuz Its My Opinion My Life My Potentials For My Wife
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World
Maybe Im Confused About What I Desire From Girls
Either Way Im All Alone Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh


Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone


Check
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet
But Theres Logic Behind It
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It
I Tend To Freak With This
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss
Thinkin She Been Spoiled
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days
And Come Up With Tin Foil

We Could Dissect It See
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing
Gave Her Nothing
Her Reputations In Jeopardy
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me
For Thinkin That Exists lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Look
If You A Girl With The Aspirations
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin
I Ask You To Have Some Patience

To My Dudes At The Bar With A Freak And
Steady Lightin Cigars At The Parties They Sneak In
And Look Forward To Being A Star On The Weekend
Ya Are Part Of The Speech Coz


Im From The City Where People Be Gettin Lazy
Litterin In The Streets
And The Club District Is Poppin Like Literally Every Week
And Promoters'll Push Flyers
Money Exchange Hands
Liars Sell You They Dreams
And Dummies Exchange Plans
Hustlers Give You Events
Bouncers Give You Pass
Directors Give Em A Shot
So Girls'll Give Up The Ass

And Groupies That Would Flock To Hometown Athletes
And Start Rolling Together Like Snoopy And Woodstock
Daffy And Bugs Its All Laughing And Hugs
Til The Dude Catch A Plane
And She Back Where She Was
Right Back On The Bus
Its Ashame Cuz Now At His Rental
She Throwin Bricks Like Shaq In The Clutch
You Can See Thats Shes Colder
Cuz He Doesnt Hold Her
Fall Flat On The Ground Trying Ta Lean On His Shoulder
Know That He Tried Ta Told Her
That He Couldnt Mold Her
If This The Type Of Chick You Wanna Be When You Older I Say


If You A Girl With The Aspirations
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin
I Ask You To Have Some Patience

To My Dudes At The Bar With A Freak And
Steady Lightin Cigars At The Parties They Sneak In
And Look Forward To Being A Star On The Weekend
Ya Are Part Of The Speech Coz


Now Up North Theres Five Artists Deservin A Listen
And Im One Of Em The Other Four You Know Who You Are
But If You Gotta Think Through
Chances Are That It Aint You
I Singlehandedly Carry Out What You Cant Do
And See I Take A Couple Of Breathers
And Then Things Come Together On The Spot Like A Couple Thats Eager
If You Wanna Pack A Duffel And Leave Her
Go Ahead I Couldnt Give Two Damns Like A Couple Of Beavers
But Uh The In & The Out

Whenever Im Out In Memphis The Man Seen As Trill
And Every Verse The Man Seem To Kill
You Can Find Him With Black Jays And Socks Like Im Andreena Mill
Japan And Brazil The Audience Acreaming
And Then You Come Around And All The Fans Seems To Chill
Advances To Deals Financing Appeals
The Hustles lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Uh Yea Get In My Slick Rick Mode
N'a Mean? Im A Tell Ya A Story Real Quick


Look
She Got A Saying Theres No Alice Without The Tin Man
Crib Was 2 Mil Plus I Just Bought A Couch For Ten Grand
Even If The House Was Ten Grand
And There Was No Pool
Would I Still Be Witout My Swim Fan?
The Ceiling Could Be Higher
She Making Requests
Dont Know If She Feeling Me Or She Be Feelin What I Buy Her
And Purses Are Light Now
She Use Em All The Time
So She Smilin To The The Point That It Hurt When She Bite Down
And She Simply A New Model
Stay Spendin Dollars
But She Got Less Sense Than A Empty Perfume Bottle
At Times She A Solid Chick
And Im A Sucka For The Cuties
So She Always Lookin Good When My Wallets Thick
Chillin On The Linen She All Up In The Closet So Much
Got A Hunch Thats Shes Feelin Other Women
Want The Diamonds On The Face In The Center
Nice Guys Finish Last So Im Winnin Every Race That I Enter And She A


Video Girl
Eh Yo You Have To Listen
Im In A Bad Position
I Fell In Love With A
Video Girl
I Wouldnt Call Her Name
I Got The Feelin That They All The Same

And She A
Video Girl
To The Fullest Extent
So I Wrote You A Song
Cuz I Cant Stay With A
Video Girl
And You Betrayed Your Wealth
Got A Feelin You Shoulda Stayed Yourself


You're All The Same
Look At Vida Guerrera
Theres No Need To Compare Her
I Bet She Smiles Cuz She Loves What She Sees In The Mirror
I Bet Shes Out Meetin Directors Instead
And Frustratrated Cuz Shes Already Been Addressed In They Head
Be A Teacher Open Up Shop If You Can Do Nails Fine
Apply For A Business Loan And I'll Bet You That They'll Sign
If You A Real Dime
Poppin As If Its Your Only Option
Girl Theres Things To Do
Other Than Jail Time
Look This Aint A Song Dissing Half Of These Rappers
Or Pasha And Sasha Esther Baxter
Melyssa Ford Or Katy Or Anyone After
I Just Give My Opinion For Laughter
Or Maybe To Think On
So Next Time You Out At The Club
And A Brother Offers The Whole Table Something To Drink On
You Just Take In Effect He Got A Stack With A Mink On
Now He Got You Doing Everything That You Think Wrong
Look You Tell Your Parents That Its Cash At An Easy Pace
Ya Dad Screaming Take Ya Ass Outta Jeezy Face
And As Ya Man I Wont Back Down First
But They Got You Doing Soft-Core Background Work
That Messed Up Like An Officer That Pulls You Over
And He Ask Questions Later And Pat Down First
But You Aint Thandie Newton And This Aint Crash Here

Drake Lyrics









Yeah This Dedicated To Canada Man
The Whole Up North
A Lot Of People Don't Realize How Cold It Gets During The Winter
But Listen...


I Met This New Girl Late June Or Early July
I Called Her A Bunch Of Times But She Barely Replied
Now It's December I'm Driving And She's Like Where's My Hi?
I Swear That I Never Called You Cause I Really Get Shy
See That Was A Segue I Believe The Matter
Is What Happens After The Seaon Where The Leaves Just Scatter
Where The Timb Laces Get Tighter And Parka Hoods Flip Up
Drugs Dealers Standin And They Parka Hoods Slip Up
Where Girls Become Exes From Summer's Caught Ho'in
The Winter Cars Come Out The Summer Cars Go In
And Some Places Is Breezy And Some It Start Snow-Ing
And If You Planning Family Vacations You Better Know When
But Some Mothers Scared To Send They Daughters Out The City
Instead She Get A Sweater That She Bought Her Out Of Pity
Cause Mom Stays Up Late She Seen Them Videos
Where Cancun College Students Pouring Water On Their Titties!


Yeah Man It's A Funny Thing Going Through The Winter Up Here Man
A Lot Of Girls Y'know Wanna Get Close. You Might Think They The One
But Just Wait Nah Mean Take It Slow


Forget To Mention This Girl That Never Gets To The Beach
She Lives Just West Of My Street And So We Destined To Meet
Since I'm Driving I Ask Her How To Get The Suite
She Doesn't Answer Opens The Door And Just Gets In The Seat
She Throws Her Bag In The Back And Starts Adjusting The Heat
She's Bold But I Roll With It I'm Impressed Cause She's Sweet
Then She Says "I Heard Your Song And I'm Obsessed With The Beat
I Mean The Lyrics Are Good But I'm Obsessed With The Beat
I Love It When Voyce Sings And The Chorus Is Good
There's A Couple Things In The Song That I Suggest You Repeat"
Off This I'm Kinda Takin It Back For A Second
I Get Her Number She Tells Me To Call Her After This Session
And So I Do And It's Kind Of Awkward The Surface Hard To Scratch
Until We End Up Sexin And Now My Heart Attached
I'm Thinkin Off I Should've Been More Southern
And Realizing All That She Wanted Was That Indoor Lovin And Ho!


Yeah Uh I Told Ya'll I Had A Story For You Right
Uh Ya Man It's What It Is


And Now I'm Proud To Have Her Like Montreal To The Frizzench
She Love To Play Hurt Like Carter Did On The Bizzench
But My Boy Say I'm Actin Different Because I Lay Downtown
And I Still I Rush To Pick Her Up From Work And Fizzench
She Tellin Everyone Imma Hold Here Down
Tell Everyone I'm The Prince Up In This Cold Clear Town
And Stupid Me I Just Listen To Her
Instead Of Wondering If This Is Really Gon' Last Me The Whole Year Round
But Then Spring Shows Up And It's Dallas In This Bitch
The Weather Starts To Resemble The Holidays She Missed
When We Were Together It Seeming Like Way Back When
Ball Players Hop On The Plane And Make It Way Back In
See She Used To Play Piana And Now She Never Wait For Santa
Instead Of Saving For Marriage She Saving For Carrabanna
And It's A Shame She Had Me Convinced That She Could've Been A Dime
I Guess I Lost Another One To The Wintertime


I Miss You Most Of Aaaallll Myy Daarling 

 Strolling In The Park 
And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing 
(Yeah Man You Know We Had To Switch It On 'em Right?)
Strolling In The Park And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing
(I'm Still Standing On Two Feet Even After This Tragic Loss)
(Man But I Got Something To Else To Tell Ya Baby)


I Remember Them Encore Pms Breakfast And The Wake Up
Now Drake's Committed We Waiting On The Breakup
So We Can Get Back To Them Cognac Nights
With Dress Codes And Light Skinned Girls That Won't Act Right
And I Laugh Cause My Previous Lifestyle Was Quite Wild
The Winter Came And Blew His Cold Air Through
Back Then Light Sweaters And A Couple Drinks Might Get Her
By The End Of The Week I Would Know That Crew
And We'd Assembled A Trio A Whole New Scene
With Three Ladies In The Shot We Never Broke Routine
At The End Of Every Cut When The Cameras Are Rollin
We Had Ladie's Hearts Always Gettin Damaged And Stolen
But This Summer Is Different It's A Two Man Operation
Granted The Fact That We One Man Short
Got Love For Him He Can Watch This New Man Stop A Nation
Cause Handin' Them Crack Is A One Man Sport
Instead Of Dress-Up I Walk In Sweat Pants And Chomp Clinkin'
I Find A Girl We Step Dance And Calm Drinkin'
The Face The Breast The Bras The Toes
I'm Still Solo And A Long Night Draws To A Close
Cause It's A Fact If She Come To The Crib And I Get Some Ass Inside
We'll Never Talk Again Scary And True
That Song Special I Recorded With Voyce Well It's Like A Classified
It's What I'm Lookin For To Carry Me Through
Yet I Can't Seem To Find A Heavy Girl That Possesses It
Only Wants A Friendship Causing Me To Forget The Shit
And When They Talk About They Past And Lovers
And You Get Mad At The Though Of It Giving Ass To Others
Yet You Find Peace With Yourself Now Least There's Some Room To Ride
There's Also Room For Improvement As Soon As June Arrive

Drake Lyrics








Southern Smoke!!!


Yeah. Ho! 
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance


You special girl don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back


Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plenty of love
And when it comes to relationships many is stuck
Look at 50 you make love 30 you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
Or maybe before I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget wait till it's right now wait till it's more 
Wait till he get gets a deal girl wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name I hope this shit is destined to change


Because you special girl don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back


I don't get it it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So I'ma change yeah this summer is gone
I'm running along before I raise one of my own


Because you special girl don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back


Believe me baby Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance uh uh uh uh uh. Uh


Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah Trendsetters

in i take q's from my big boy popz
i 'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
they getting foul on the star
but its all eyes on me like im coppin some vows for the bar
get it guess not picture me not strive
to land in the top ten slip in the top five
same thing in the top four trust im hot boy
maybe even the top three Trey you got me
now a day i peep they intrests
specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
money making brothers should take notes
see broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
some body get the waiter they need a second plate a
this knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later
my money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up
i put a split in the middle then i seperater


It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game


Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more


It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live it don't stop
Baby it's about the game


When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough for the flow for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game


The haters wanna hate but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me 


It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live it don't stop
Baby it's about the game


Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more


The haters wanna hate but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me 


It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game

It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live lyrics

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve All this Love !!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me and I know
I can't contain myself All this Love !!


Girl I've been thinking about the way that you love me every day
And I want to know if You Feel The Same Way!!
Because I'm in and out of town that's just how I got's to get down
But you understand that's why I'm your man!!


I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve All this Love !!

They say he wanted the bounce back
I can make them easily admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where me accounts at
Yeah you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they don't like me
They throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son you figure Drake knew Sam. L 
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh


I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve All this Love !!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me and I know
I can't explain myself All this Love !!


Even when the sun don't shine I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!


I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve All this Love !!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me and I know
I can't contain myself lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Niggas in the city hatin' me man they trippin'
When I'm the only one that's really spittin'
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really grippin'
Why you deck me up actin' like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?

Uh I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA Toronto Hip-Hop

 
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the timbs here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbin on 
These rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they neega
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost for prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanca from Street Fighter heat got a
Hurricane kick murder everything quick
Look my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent sentence indent on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin
That its crack we placed in your stereo system
Yea I be at your burial trippin
Nickelus F from Richmond
VA 
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day


I've been hated by many wanted by plenty
Disliked by some but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity I load up lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
But compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be
You got blind heaters in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touchin my palm
Seein your physical the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artist feelin threatened
Cause I'm harnessin a weapon won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
To play around to perfection I'm the spittin image
My verbal camp is vivid I told you I'm spittin image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say 
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You aint Morris Chestnut you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protege that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Southern Smoke!!!


Yeah. Ren. M.O.F. Haha. 
It's Drake man. It's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma half to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO!  Southern Smoke!!!


Very few give you that truth it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit they cancel what they doing
The samples that they using can't get through the clearing
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careering forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doing what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue your son he gon miss you
And plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
Now you looking for exes you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time and me I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment or question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'ma support her I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border 
But


I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO! BO! BO! BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO! BO! BO! BO!


This is my life and so the rest is kinda been cool question what I been through
I write a verse addressing it and yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a  I'd punch them I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy plus I'm Jewish he don't approve I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding not Barry White
Because black is black honey even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist


I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO! BO! BO! BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO! BO! BO! BO!


Am I hot as the rest should I strive for my spot as the best
Like girls with Double D's I gotta lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of staring at quizzes  now it's models with breasts
And yes when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician 
Homie I probably could of been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo or maybe Petey's assistant 
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me
So if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson
Nigga get the handgun
If not you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been
Around the world and back and I don't wanna question half the places Nick been


I got stress on my shoulders 
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder 
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older 
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers 
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO! BO! BO! BO! 
I'm just trying to live my life cuz 
Make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz BO! BO! BO! lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
Symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics 
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
Niggas wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town


You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try


And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting' is fresher 
than most of these rappers running the game
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a range"Kick Push " lyrics

Drake Lyrics




"Kick Push "





Uh what up y'all!
Soundtrack what's popping baby?
Y'all ain't know I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteen
Jyea uh!
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying?
Legally and illegally
Hahaha...
You know what I'm talking about?
So check it out


First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it just the first kickflip he land it
Uh labeled a misfit a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yea when they said "It's getting late in here..
...so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"


And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast


(Waddup Lupe Chi Town!)
My style is very Tennessee
mixed with some Terry Kennedy
people barley remember me from back in the day
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
luckly my aunt working as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
if i 'm staying in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she say you need to be doing something other than skating
why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
so now its me and old school
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
he knew i didn't really wanna post here
open up the window told me that the coast clear
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes i'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
kick flip in the air
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
just so the space ain't restricted in here
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
i say aunty this is a safe career
she said Drake i told you there's no skating here


And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So let's kick... and push... and coast


Before he knew he had a crew
That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said 


And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push lyrics

SHAKE UP THE WORLD
THAT IS WHAT I AM BOUT TO DO
And homie you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you I got enough cloud for two
And like a nxgga turn blood I came out the blue
They like "damn who's drake where's wheel-chair-Jimmy at?"
On my chris brown shxt. I'm still here. gimme dat
I'm cuttin lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers luke-warm like redwine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet so I'm still budgetin'
I'm like jeopardy-I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you gotta nephew or a cousin in
 I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways

Cause I need drug money
Who got drug money
I am talkin  money
I am talkin  money
And no I ain't emotional but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin stars
Why you gotta act dumb 
Your girl kno how I beat it like a flat drum
I spit dirty like I'm chewin on black gum
I fooled ya'll ain't shxt for me to come back from




Ooooohhh!
Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this
extravaganza that I call Comeback Season. Hope you enjoy your stay
drinks are on my by the way  yeah


How the fuck jay and dame gon' break up before they meet drake
I'm sure it can be resolved I'm just hopin that they make up
I've perfected my craft using ? 
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
GET IT? !
Craft. single. cheese. process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch no less
Oh yes
I'm known in the city but need to bust out like a model to show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin it clean in a little X direction
And babygirl if you don't like me it's probably due to the fact that you are last like next selection
The city is mine I control this
You know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm ?  you ?  this
I'm a jamaican doctor The Bay lyrics

Drake Lyrics








I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost 
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man
But dog
You don't know me 
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out 
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean
And dog 
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC MTV Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb 
Ticket on the dash
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard 
So I am what they gotta be
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire 
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows 
And tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me 
You mean ros?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Yeah I remember me and me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but probably tell you a lil' somethin' now


Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-trn had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
'Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you' talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
'Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Fillipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like 
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it 'cause I know I put you through it 
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table 
And say  
And it wasn't nothin' tooo it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out


Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF 
Miss Andreena Mill


Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video 
Which made everything right with X 
I got too many records and not enough shows
For too many rappers and not enough __
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my  shit the 
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home


Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
 lights 'bout to go down curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement


Lat me show what it is
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
if you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like

Ooo wee

Took 'em from white snakes to

Ooo wee

This metaphore might sound a little confusing but

Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah

I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us 
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince he rep two up two down
Anyone I know get used to me
Im far from the man that I used to be 
I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providing that
Understand that I'm worldwide
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK
From Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans
But yo this hook is for my exes


This one is for you girl
You know who you are girl
You only show you're face
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you trying to to make it
Don't ever mistake it
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you 
You had a chance now It's gone
Oooooh
You had a man now you don't 
Back to the basics
I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl


Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly
Lookin for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life
Tryin to find another one tonight
And if it's you baby
Let yourself be seen
Don matter skirts
Dresses or jeans
I got that work
Know what I mean
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean




Check this out
from the that she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA VA
NY TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement

This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice just got clean rap
Don't ever two step I just rock lean snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular ? they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game in the city that I claim


Yo the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up range rove yo chick wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna 
Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go!
Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go!


Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama get it how you live that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny that's when you dip dip
And it's a trip my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface uh
Ya boy say this that and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence come into your yard and collect lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year money like a cashier so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine shine
And I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line line
And I got way too much love for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me I deport 'em the city is mine boy


Yo the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up range rove yo chick wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna 
Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it

Shake shake it drop it drop it bounce it bounce it wop it wop it

Yeah Look
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat
And go ahead claim it
I'm about to paint a picture
You niggas go 'head frame it
'cause we getting Seinfeld
On some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards
I will fold 'em with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rollin' wit' some jokers 
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn could you niggas get any broker
Got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment
Don't even approach her
Disguise yourself go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock room 
And I was praying I would drop June but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rockin' for Pete's sake
You fake gangsta rappers are clich
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I be in your face like 
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They tryna be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for your ulterior motives
'Cause if you like it you should stick with me
My money good I ain't ever had to flip a key
A lot of ice a lot of cream like Dicky D
Might cut the phone and disappear like Mishy me
But I'm tryna have you on that trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he'd be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out his cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this pardon me while I fix
Couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point I'm just poking her body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girl's keep telling me I'm still as snobby
I tell 'em myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seems like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades fade with waves I smirk at a nigga if he still rockin' braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page and that goes out to every nigga except Trey
Ay I'm outta here baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back nah not if you paid me
Mister bet you that's expensive cause it's not a Fugayze
Spittin' that crock pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty how is it tasting
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget a girl they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke leave these niggas some hope
He took that
'Ye beat and you put that shit in a choke
well I think that I should leave out on this note nigga keep your two cents
I ain't tryna leave you broke
Life of a Don lights keep glowing
coming in the club with that fresh shit on with something crazy in my arm 
and here's another hit lyrics

Drake Lyrics








I'on think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before...
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understands tha fact that I'm spending off shore dough
Cash only transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they don't know I bought it
I been doin' this for years homie thoroughly I've thought it
Through what it do I am currently recorded on a track admitting most of my currency's imported
We're too late now too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're crimes that I did commit
Repeat offender Anita Baker playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A mitchkeit as they say he's a legal bender
And ATF is present every legal memeber
The coalition we so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely meant for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in a basement that Rennie Grew was piffin'
When pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team playin' no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games coach I'm through assistin'
The take over the break's over nigga
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And this the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talkin' 'bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Take what you want take what you wa-ah-aha-ant 
Take what you want take what you want
But lyrics

Check look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya ya ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best decisions you've made
I'm sonnin'/sunnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me Trey's girl go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
Bu you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you and you take it the best


When I give ya what I give ya

When I give ya what I give ya

It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl 'cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya

When I give ya what I give ya

It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl 'cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya


(It's The Prince look here)
Yup it's me again Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face slim waist lyrics

Drake Lyrics





(feat. Little Brother Dwele)




Don't you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? 
It's alllll-right with me my girl
We can do anything


Why you over there lookin at me?
Why your man stand-in right beside ya?
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
but you know and I know that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna say you like a goalie in line of sight
I know that I feel a bit slowly I'm kinda like

and so she want this chef stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well I'ma give it to you honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it they wanna wrap it and cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...




Look...we had a lil' thing a wintertime fling
You some  for your man mistreat thing
But that was then you know some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus your man still there let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late night smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
and somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about cause I been the other man
and you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad shoulda chose a wo-man
but I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin you need to do what you do
I'm NOT tryna take it any further with you C'MON




Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in she out and when she in I'm gone 
We lost contact like ? shalom
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
wit this new cat sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute she mad at me next minute it's all good
and I'm in her body like Grey's Anatomy
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do 
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself "Damn if only her nigga knew" what?
 yeah..




Don't you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? 
It's alllll-right with me my girl
We can do anything lyrics

Drake Lyrics








Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yea... Can ya'll hear me out there
It's a lovely night tonight ain't it
Yea I know
I know what they thinkin they lyrics

Drake Lyrics





(feat. Andreena Mill Kardinal Offishall)




I gotta make it out or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope
Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front lines with my weapon
I am the last hope


Can you i-magine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The microphone brings life and death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross border smugglers tussle to burn weed
It means that pressure of success in the south
Niggas watchin' what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holdin' the torch
When the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on holdin' it forever
My names Kardinall




Jealousy's suttin I haven't felt for years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove
I'm incredible fuckin' unforgettable
And when it comes to records 
I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always foreseen
That's why I'm steady getting more money lyrics

Drake Lyrics








I swear to Lord same dudes use to laugh at me
See me in the CL6 with half a bead
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me I have to blow a couple stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck ya'll haters on behalf of me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talkin me and two partners in that caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars fast women fast cash and c.r.e.a.m
Commode you rappers like plasticine
I have the dream but dawg me and success are two things you don't wanna find yo ass between
Back against the wall like plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pastured green
And you are now hangin with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave earth nothin left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is New Years
Say whatever I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm comin with two spears
I'm tellin you dawg always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up makin executive calls
And with me women be bulidin these skeptical walls
But once you've slept with one dime man you've slept with 'em all
Family money and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin stop actin like teen girls are my only market
I parallel to fly and spurk Tony Barket
And it's cool if you spill something it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior color only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin today then you ain't makin records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm givin away lyrics

Drake Lyrics










I do this for ya'll man
Malice Nickelus F it's the REMIX!


Lights slow motion steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall with b-boys dancin'
Ears neck and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick each arm makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin' cars wit' options
We livin' like kings homie you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin' cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes we cross seasons
Escaped indictments thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper and that's how we do


R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G


Stance on lean leg up on the wall
My people they chill why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh do what you do what you I do what I do
Do's what you do I do what I do

Stance on lean leg up on the wall
My people they chill why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh do what you do what you I do what I do
Do's what you do I do what I do


Check the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me for your sake might wanna return it
Cause if you bring them discs home to ya girl she'll forget you
and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is you just notice me now but I was here along
your vision's just been distorted
I'm so  I live this you ask me what the business
and I write a sixteen and record it uh
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed I got this dude
they expectations Imma exceed it uh
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here Imma star with the timing
My swagger is chill and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash and purchasing fast
you only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
MY pain you can experience through the rhyming boy!


Stance on lean leg up on the wall
My people they chill why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh do what you do what you I do what I do
Do's what you do I do what I do

Stance on lean leg up on the wall
My people they chill why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh do what you do what you I do what I do
Do's what you do I do what I do




Stance on lean leg up on the wall
My people they chill why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring and I'm gettin it in the fall

Do's what you do I do what I do

Stance on lean leg up on the wall
My people they chill why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh do what you do what you I do what I do
Do's what you do lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Yeah look...
Me and sos? we from two different walks of life
usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to vice
the watch is yellowy-green thas sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice lyrics that I often write
Spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off the night
drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this tell me if the coffin's light
but don't try and tell me that a dolphins white
mislead drake that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin like no time
They'll be trynna sub a nigga in like Quizno's


All I need is sum weight my scale sum money for bail
A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel
nigga my drink my smoke a bird on E
And somethin heavy on my waist man I'm easy to please
I need my moms my pa a bottle of cliqua
the whole ATF you kno who we are..
my women my money lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Yeah 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though


Uh we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me


Uh El' be saying that I'm humble I'm hella nice
For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
Haters tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But uh they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha I can't lie you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'm a take this hat off and I'm a hit it till I backs off
And then I'm back sorrowful
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping




You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-trail don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature
Such an anomaly speak so well
And talk so collegy such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me cause I ain't dumb shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned uh c'mon




They say you never judge a book by it's cover
Though you appear as materialistic lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Me and you so crucial baby and that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't used to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tin roof it's crazy
That's a metaphor did I lose you baby?

When you are wet
And covered in sweat
I wipe your ass down like Boosie baby

I love all my feed back
Tell me to give it to you if you need that
Touch right there whatever the speed's at
If it's over fast then I promise you a relapse

Forget what you guessin' I'm on
And who was in yo past
I'm a freshly grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you let us girl I'm a bring the dresser along

You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest Patrn
Show up on time for the class I'm teachin
'Cause guaranteed I'm a bring a lesson along

An you just gotta bring yo breasts along
Instead of holding out wondering what it could've been
I confess this address to you and
I'm the postman lookin for a slot I can put it in

With no NY number
Mom's still upstairs I'm two floors under
But my room's soundproof
You so tempted
To satisfy your urge so you don't wonder 

I know I told you before
I'll grab that for you like holdin' the door
'Cause mines is Polo and yours is Vicky
And they just spread all over the floor lyrics

Drake Lyrics










I can't stop missing you wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO


Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars
I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would of cared more
That's my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records more sex more babies
Yeah wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you I'm tryna make you a misses


I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out do you still live at your old house
Do you got somebody new in your life
Cause I can't get you outta my mind


And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't


I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop


Missin everything you say
Missin all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this with out you here
Baby 07' supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind


And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't


I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO


Wish I Could wake up and forget about you
Not tryin to call you when I know I want to
(O wish I) I gotta fight this feeling can't let it take over me
You just don't understand how much you were apart of me


I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO


I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO


I can't stop missing you
I can't stop missing you
 I can't stop missing you
 I can't stop missing you
No No No No
I can't stop lyrics

Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old I'm the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn!
That punch line was predictable
I still got you shittin' bricks homie quit the bull
And we don't need new members
To me the clique is full
And I be getting' the same women that tip the pool
Believe or not
I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buyin' the Louie that Kanyizzy cop
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock
This shit is east pot
That's why I'm ready man
I'd never copy Norbit like eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head?
Did you forfeit?
Yeah I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big she just tryin' to make a four fit
Yeah they need ot issue out a recall
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall
The fundamental are needed you playin' street
And I was out at BET but I didn't see ya'll
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Yep!


Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like round one round two round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause ain't no nigga like a young money nigga
No ain't no nigga like me
Ya dig?


I said I know you see me chillin'
Super low key
If I'm with the right niggas you can scoop a O.Z.
All the hustlers and the bouncers
And the groupies know me
Fresh denim fresh shades
In a group with no kids
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cuttin' we can cut some more
Then after you get high make 'em get 'em girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got alota dough
Plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain't heard?
I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain't really got a choice it's an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city it's a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison
They takin' too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
'Cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop they braggin' 'bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at 50 000's goin' gold
Holla at me when you see me make yourself known
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga be a man
You actin' like a bitch
I ain't actin' like I'm rude
I'm just actin' like I'm rich rich
Yeah uh!
Ridin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin' baby?
'Cause I don't waste time can't yo see a nigga lazy?
And I might need some help
But you know Weezy's fuckin' crazy


Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right

'Cause ain't no nigga like a young money nigga

I'm tryin to do it all tonight I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight before it lands... before it lands

But you can miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say (no no no)
My ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let (go go go)
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see everytime that I'm here
But when I'm not really even here
Black surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'm a be the one to pour cement on it
Uh lyrics

Drake Lyrics








Hey there pretty girl
You know exactly what you got and I don't blame you at all...
You can't resist it...
Especially when the lights so bright and the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leaveeeeeeeee
She just stuck in...

Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down ooooooo

She doesnt ever worry if she wants it she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life and shes scared of ending up alone

Throw your 1's up in the air
Throw your 1's up in the air for her
Throw your 1's up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down oooooo

We all got dreams and we all star reaching all star peaking all-star weekend...
One hotel room and all ya'll sleeping housekeeping knock to see if all ya'll decent
Young girls envy the life ya'll leading never satisfied with a nice calm evening
You be at the games looking right all season
But you always with me on the night ya'll leaving

Ass low ass low I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget:
Who or Why or How or When
Tonight is probably about to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you...
Although I would be glad to...
I probably go and tattoo... your name on my heart
I swear
I start
To think
That I'm going crazy

Throw your 1'ss up in the air
Throw your 1's up in the air for her
Throw your 1's up in the air
'Cause the 1's you throw will get her out of:

Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down lyrics

Drake Lyrics





(feat. Trey Songz Lil Wayne)




I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.


Drizzy
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it
I live it
To me there's nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems
Too much would kill ya
And when I leave
I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of you all still sounding like last year
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier
Nickels for my thoughts
Dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush
Shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious ya hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD
Yeah
I want it all
That's why I strive for it
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.


Yeah
I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother tried to runaway from home
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet
She only 5'2
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn my reality just set in
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things
Hoping I never have to fit in
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
And life change for us every single week
So it's good
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand
This lost boy got fly without peter pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store
Just call me shop and bag drizzy
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag
But bitches cartate
Long bread I don't eat shortcake
How come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese
But shes not in this portrait
Life's fine but I don not portray
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow
I want the glow ray
And I'm a fuck the world
But this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit
Bring her on to cowshit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
That's word to toronto
So high up I got birds in the condo
Ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her
And she yell god lyrics

Drake Lyrics









Uh when did you get like this
Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me


Did you agree we should let it be
And did you agree it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us


When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store


Did you agree we should let it be
And did you agree it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us


Leave me leave me I can't fuckin stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend my girlfriend call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But ion really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call
You jus tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that... do that... do that
Yeah


Did you agree we should let it be
And did you agree it's a must lyrics

Drake Lyrics









It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
Seen ya picture
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and gitcha 

One time for the homie dj screw
Already... I'm feelin throwed in this bitch


I'm so high even when I'm comin down
Just met a girl said she from the h-town
Said my name was drizzy
And ain't nobody reala
Cup inside a cup
Smokin ghostface killah
Got these boppas goin crazy
Nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message said I'll see you when I can
She sent me one back
But I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it
And I'm tellin you


 I'm always with a dime in the winter
And I be ridin rims if my tires any thinner
Airports stuntin flyin charters overseas
Full of don perignon
And the water for the d's
Don't know why it happens everytime we're alone
But here we are again
And I swear I'm in ma zone
So I'm a sip this drink till that mofucka gone
And you gon' get undressed
And we gon' get it on


I don't give you the time
You deserve from me
This is something I know
I know I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like
We're in Houston
Takin everything slow
So slow so slow
But I do it to her


Draped up dripped out
Know what I'm talkin bout
3 in the mornin get it poppin in the parkin lot
It's on once again
And I never pretend
A nigga stay g to the end


I swear like lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Yeah I appreciate ya patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's just best to keep quiet
But uh sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young angel and young lion
You know what it is uh


Look I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes
Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma
I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin that shit that they shot pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sittin there wishing they problems became ours
Cause we have nothing in common
Since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving right in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck English
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriend's waking up ringer
Heh or alarm or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures
And me doing them shows gettin everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters gonna have to get alone with them hood niggas
It's all good I'm going off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta rent a movie called hoes over
Rest in peace to heath ledger but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya got no holster
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and tez got a cig but I'm no smoker
They just handing chips to me nigga no poker
I'm with it young money cash money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year '06 Chris Paul shit
D.r. c.j an po' I see y'all
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free weezy go


And I take probation
I don't want that t.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane big location
Going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah I don't stunt I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones junior fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit don't leave me un-guarded
And I'm a cheese head word to Vince Lombardi
Word to marky mark leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recording I'm just C-4'in
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in ya pocket an pay homage
Better cover ya eyes ya face falling
Watch the game from the side I'm play calling
No I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for ya garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y no homo I'm on it
Weezy f baby new born bitch
You know what they say bout when ya palm itch
I'm gonna get money money I'm gonna get
Young money in ya tummy and we gonna shit
An get that toilet paper quick like when bone spit
That's right bitch I'm back on my grown shit
That oughta Marvin Gaye no ice just chrome shit
And ya boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream fuck the world with a long dick
Motherfucker I'm me yeah bitch I'm me
You niggas sweet like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down ya entire street
So fly I'm a take off when I leap bye
And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money headbutt yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if ya touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like tila tequila
Yeah I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screaming motherfucker do you hear her

Drizzy drake what the lick read
We make magic boy Roy and Sigfried
Who! young mullah baby lyrics

Drake Lyrics








Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio is in character
As if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it is if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back
But It's hard thinkin in polite flows/
When Stephano Polato suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight close
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full now the shit just been lypo'd
Always said I'll say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera someone got to tape this
I make hits and like a bitch that's married I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watch Hov's show embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't want to feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonders where my mind is account's in the minus
And yet I role around the fucking city like ya highness
Got niggaz reacting without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
Cause I just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now
And shit can get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul
And Silvia be telling Taz damn Drake fly
And he just be like silly motherfucker I know
That was your bad how can you pass up on 'em
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em
Oh they did Po at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah before they told me to 'do me'
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could have fooled me
Boy and to my city I'm the Two Three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So If you find a blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit I'm getting better still
Little niggaz put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause it's Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got that making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real
Yea lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Hands down
I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of


But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
'cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing so I just ignore you yeah
Oh oho
But your on my mind my mind my mind my mind my mind
Oh oho
But maybe in time in time in time
I'll tell you


A little bit a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit a little bit a little bit in love with you
Oh oho


I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah


I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
'cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit

You would do it
You would say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha hm

I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me


I hope they never find out
What they already know know know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go go go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both n'sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just so wrong
I wonder where my whereabouts?
Where niggas that I know tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit
tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know yeah tell her all that that
And as for you I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...

A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me
Oh oho oh lyrics

You know a lot of girls be...thinking my songs about them but
This is not to get confused this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had 
I say you the fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there 
I be over there shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it I'm the one that never get confused wit

'cause...



Sex love pain baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had 
I say...
You the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had 

Uhh ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody

Yeah uh-huh


Uh hardly home but always reppin
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake you always restin
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question
I I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes
Shit been goin good but good can turn to better
Cause you the type to lose her and I'm about to get her


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Yeah wrong way down the one way
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday
Damn where I get it from these niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you''
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady
They just loose to love those are tennis games lady
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady
Damn who's line is it anyways
I'm in the daze you been amazed y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze
I got dough to blow but I wanna blow it right
You look nice and yo frame makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright guess I might know what fuck it yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb
im like a SPALDING bout to take flight
from the free throw line and slam it down like im the great Mike
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton so what the fuck is you on?


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city

You can run an tell my city it's on

I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear your the last thing on my mind yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it
(All you ever asked me for was time whoa)

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else 

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited to long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else 

The girl or the world you see someone gotta lose
I thought that I can have it all
Do I really got to choose?
What good in all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good in being famous if I'm never on your mind?

Night's fallen lyrics

Drake Lyrics










Even though your all alone
All I know when I am gone

I just wanna keep you warm
I'm comin' back I'm comin' back

Yes I'll be there
Yes I'll be there

Cause when I'm all alone I think about your face
And how I wanna touch I'm so far away 

All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah


Don't go missing
fly with me
Don't go missing
fly with me fly with me
Don't go missing
fly with me
check it out check it out
Don't go missing
fly with me fly with me


I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet

Promise that I won't forget
I'm comin' back I'm comin' back

Yes I'll be there
Yes lyrics

Uh I'm just so far gone october's own Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone I call this shit the calm
Yea but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...


You know everything gone be alright I promise. A
Pologize to you know to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say "Don't ask permisson just ask forgiveness"
You know so... forgive me.


Uh And life is so insane look what I've became tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain...


Me Yea... Uh lyrics

Drake Lyrics









This here is on some truthful shit!
Its seems like everything I do your use to it!
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside.
So you still think I am confident and damn
Is this gonna last?
Your up on a pedastool.
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past.
That's why I gotta ask...


Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?
Brand New 
Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?
Brand New 
Girl



This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you atempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So i can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask...




Is anything I'm doing Brand New?
New 
Is everything I'm doing to late?
Late 
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very 1st date?
Tell me baby lyrics

Drake Lyrics








Hey there pretty girl
You know exactly what you got and I don't blame you at all...
You can't resist it...
Especially when the lights so bright and the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leaveeeeeeeee
She just stuck in...

Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down ooooooo

She doesnt ever worry if she wants it she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life and shes scared of ending up alone

Throw your 1's up in the air
Throw your 1's up in the air for her
Throw your 1's up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down oooooo

We all got dreams and we all star reaching all star peaking all-star weekend...
One hotel room and all ya'll sleeping housekeeping knock to see if all ya'll decent
Young girls envy the life ya'll leading never satisfied with a nice calm evening
You be at the games looking right all season
But you always with me on the night ya'll leaving

Ass low ass low I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget:
Who or Why or How or When
Tonight is probably about to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you...
Although I would be glad to...
I probably go and tattoo... your name on my heart
I swear
I start
To think
That I'm going crazy

Throw your 1'ss up in the air
Throw your 1's up in the air for her
Throw your 1's up in the air
'Cause the 1's you throw will get her out of:

Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlanta... she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes
Hey now now watch her go down lyrics

(feat. Trey Songz Lil Wayne)




I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.


Drizzy
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it
I live it
To me there's nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems
Too much would kill ya
And when I leave
I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of you all still sounding like last year
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier
Nickels for my thoughts
Dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush
Shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious ya hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD
Yeah
I want it all
That's why I strive for it
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.


I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.


Yeah
I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother tried to runaway from home
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet
She only 5'2
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn my reality just set in
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things
Hoping I never have to fit in
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
And life change for us every single week
So it's good
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...


I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.


Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand
This lost boy got fly without peter pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store
Just call me shop and bag drizzy
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is


I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say
I just don't know how to say it to you


Pardon the swag
But bitches cartate
Long bread I don't eat shortcake
How come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese
But shes not in this portrait
Life's fine but I don not portray
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow
I want the glow ray
And I'm a fuck the world
But this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit
Bring her on to cowshit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
That's word to toronto
So high up I got birds in the condo
Ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her
And she yell god lyrics

Drake Lyrics








You know a lot of girls be...thinking my songs about them but
This is not to get confused this ones for you...


Baby you're my everything you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had 
I say you the fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there 
I be over there shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it I'm the one that never get confused wit

'cause...



Sex love pain baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had 
I say...
You the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had 

Uhh ah yea
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are lyrics

Drake Lyrics





(feat. Bun B Lil Wayne)




Yeah uh-huh


Uh hardly home but always reppin
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake you always restin
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question
I I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes
Shit been goin good but good can turn to better
Cause you the type to lose her and I'm about to get her


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Yeah wrong way down the one way
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday
Damn where I get it from these niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you''
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady
They just loose to love those are tennis games lady
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady
Damn who's line is it anyways
I'm in the daze you been amazed y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze
I got dough to blow but I wanna blow it right
You look nice and yo frame makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright guess I might know what fuck it yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on


Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb
im like a SPALDING bout to take flight
from the free throw line and slam it down like im the great Mike
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton so what the fuck is you on?


It's okay 
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on 
Best believe I understand
It's okay 
You can run an tell my city
I'm on 
You can run an tell my city it's on
