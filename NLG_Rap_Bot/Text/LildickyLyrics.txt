Whoa... so hard
Jews is never supposed to go ham but fuck it


Okay dat boy D I C K Y ballin
I been spitting hella writtens cause I'm fittna get ma wallet good
Bitches know I holla good
Graduated college with a bag of fucking honors but instead of making dollars
I been acting like a kiddd
Rapping bout ma fucking dickkk
And what started as a joke became the hottest fucking shit
Killin bitches Michael Vickin women you know what dis is
Semi colons in ma texts ma instant message game is sick ho
Fuck that shit when I rub that bitch
When I be up in the club I gotta tuck that dick
When I bring a chicken back and then I fuck that bitch
I'm a cum quick I ain't playin witcha
Ay you kno I'm spittin crack up on the track
I'm not attacking all you blacks
Who try to rap but I'm just sayin that


I'm coming for these muthafuckin brothas makin money
Errybody love the funny little buddy makin jams now
Ladies get dem pants down
Sorry to my God and my synoguge and my mom because this kike is goin ham now


I ain't on that kosher shit
Facebook I be poking chicks
Came up in the 90's yeah I'm on some hocus pocus shit
Ion't push a lotus I'm drivin a fuckin focus
But notice that I got the coldest and dopest designer sodas
I'm an izze sippin biddie kissin muthafuckin G
The way cum on chickens call lil dicky mozzarella cheese
I'm getting pussy getting bread I get a lot of fucking yeast
And I been dustin diamonds off they bout to call lil dicky screech whoa
Tampon shit
Cause I rap for da flow
And I get a lotta bitches when I mac like a pro
Gotta mac it's a pro
Never nap but I doze
I'm a little bit of black like I shat in the snow
And I know ya'll bitches feelin that
Ain't as nobody real as that I'm
Rapping like Jamaica's population I been killin trackssss




See dem bitches over there?
Please don't fucking over stare
Das who I be stroking young and smoking like they over DARE
Okay I was joking I don't know dem I should grow a pair
But I am not the most efficient closer when I'm sober scared
So I'm drinkin lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








Ey what's going on man?
It's your boy Lil Dicky
A.K.A Mr. Left-Ward-Sloping-Penis
I got a story for y'all man
Peep this
Yes sir

Now I been dating this girl named Katie she hot as hell
And her body crazy vagina shaven and it don't smell
And I don't fall for chickens
But this one a little different
Body sickening
Plus she really good at making breaded chicken
Got me thinking she the one man
Even fully clothed shawty really fun man
Get a lotta hoes but none of those come close
I swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposed
Oh yeah there's one more thing
And I know this shit gonna sound insane
But I still haven't hit it
I admit it I wish I was kidding
Never been up inside before
Because shes only fucked one guy before
And though I really wanna boink this whore
She ma sweetie 3.14
So I'm staying patient and masturbating
And now ma heart is sorta racing
Cause she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating
Hell yeah I'm down I'm bout to go all out
I'm gonna pound that crazy like an elaborate black man handshake
But on the way to crib we pass this kid
And he seem to know who Katie is
So I say  and she say
Dicky this is my ex boyfriend Jim"

And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm looking at this dude I can't believe my eyes
Cause he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life
He's got the thickest head of hair chiseled jaw an egregious bod
Man this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian God
And now I'm looking at ma chick cause his dick's been inside her raw

Awww damn
Man this is crazy
I can't believe this guy used to fuck ma lady
I bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti
Katie's hugging and squeezing his shoulder blades
And I'm bugging and queasy this ain't okay
And then they say  so I say okay
Even though I was about to get laid!
Man this motherfucker look like Ashton
Combined with a little Hugh Jackman
In other words he's so damn attractive
So damn tan he gotta have a little black in him
Now I'm in the back with him sipping on some 'gnac with him
And he paying for it all he investment banking...
I'm acting like I ain't distracted
But I'm reenacting him and Katie banging
And now I'm feeling pissed so I go and take a piss
Mid stream I look left and guess who it is
And I had to see and I was mad discrete
And I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek
Oh my God Becky look at that cock

And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm looking at his dick I can't believe my eyes
Because he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life
And now I'm staring at this dude's soft dick with a lotta hate
Because the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate
And I don't know if I can date ma girl after tonight

Aw damn

I don't know what to do
Dude's dick is really huge
I didn't realize a penis could be so smooth
I know she's mission that
My penis isn't that
I'm looking closer I think that his dick has abs
Six pack on a dick
Now what the fuck is that
It's so long and thick
It's like a punching bag
I'm saying it's so shaven head is amazing
Got ma dick looking like a raisin
Skin tone insane man he's hung like Saddam Hussein it's crazy
What the fuck should I do?
He gotta Ruth's Chris dick and mine's a drive through...
I think it's time to
Tell Katie ma goodbyes
Cause I simply can't survive
After seeing what was in between his thighs
So I tell her

That this dude's gotta dick that I don't comprehend
I had to move ma neck to see it end to end
I mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense
And I think it's for the best if this comes to an end
Because the sex with him must have been the best
And I would say let's just be friends
But I think I would just think about his dick all the time so goodbye
Then she told me Dicky I don't really know what to say
Because I dated this dude in the second grade
So I don't know about his dick now let's go home and get you laid

And then I took her to ma crib and you know that we barely slept
And I gave her an O like I was selling crack lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Yeah... sounds kinda beautiful don't it?
Fair warning I'm about to shit on it

Let's go let's go let's go


Okay now you already know that Dicky been about that flow all day
I used to beg to get blow J's I'm over head now stowaway
My team about that money tho we scrappin fo that dummy dough
Don't act like das yo money ho das nacho cheese das doritos
And I spit that hot shit all day long gotta room full a hot chicks no Krayshawn
And you know they blonde got em in suede thongs
And they ass meat lookin like filet mignon
You can find me back a da club I'm wylin
Shots in a mafuckan mug I'm buyin
No I ain't a mafuckan thug but I will cut a rug in this mafucka
Carpet violence
In the crib with dat AC on
No fib ya girl up in a lacy thong
Cause the kid been known to make a racy song
Dicky got it goin on like I'm Stacy's mom
I'm higher than I ever been flyer than a pelican
No lie see mo vagina than a common OBGYN
I'm ballin whatchu know bout that
In a purple charlotte throwback hat
And I merc these tracks when I heard this rap
Got me actin like I'm erkel did I do that
Hell yeah I did you know I do it
And the way they fallin for me like I'm boys with cupid
In a truck with a slut with a butt get a nut
Call that bitch bill buckner the way she blew it
I'm high off weed and oxycodon
I'm a caffeine fiend takin shots a soda
Wish I was big pimpin on a yacht with Hova
But I'm happy that ma girl lemme motorboat her
I make this shit look easy dude
I spit dat sick dat sneeze achu
And who knew that baddest was a
Nappy headed greasy Jew?


Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Lil Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Sicker than the holocaust
Dat muthafuckin jewish flow
That third reich raw
Concentration camp cold
Now we rollin in that mothafuckin dough
Das dat Jewish flow
Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Lil Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Sicker than the holocaust
Dat muthafuckin jewish flow
That Auschwitz sick gas chamber kinda shit
Now I got german bitches all up on ma dick
Das dat jewish flow


Blowin up you know that's DI
Flowin since ya boy was knee high
Now I'm grown up and ya'll buggin cause I'm buzzin like a beehive
Shout out to my city Philly big ups to PA
I went to college in VA but now I'm chillin by the bay
And I got ma shit on lock cause I ball like a jock
They attached to my balls like a small little cock
No bullshit dicky do it big no doubt
And ya girl in the whirpool wet no draught
And she get so loud I be like slow down
Lemme relish this shit girl no kraut
And then I beat that like it was a title bout
And then I plant my seed that ho got plowed
Ew you so nasty lil dicky you so nasty
I got green knees why you keep yo crib so grassy?
I do it how I do it baby swag out the ass
And I'm shittin on you dick heads like a drag the asshooole
Don't cha know my girls DTF
And they pretty damn fine das PDF
I'm a open that I'm a cum press that
I got Adobe Acrobat
Ma homies say that pussy takes a toll on dudes
But my EZ pass dick just slides right through ooo




You know that dicky bout to bubble up
Fresha than a mothafuck
I gotta gang a bitches whatchu know about a cluster fuck
The back of the crack of that ass is poking outcha pants
I'm a crack from the back and ejaculate all on that ass
N'amsayin I'm cool ass mafucka try to see me
If you want ma life better find a genie
In the club tryna choose but I'm bein greedy
So you know I pick six like a deion TD
Cause I got that swag that y'all don't have
Is that yo girl das ma bad
The sickest shit out two lips heavy flow lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









And y'ain't even want it with da boy
Cause the way I'm livin life is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I.
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude


Shit I'm living good up in this bitch
Dicky rollin round the city blowin good up in that wip
I ain't black or Dominican not Hispanic or Indian
So imprisonment is not a predicament I envision
For a white boy
Hollatcha muthafuckin kike boy
Higher than a muthafuckin kite it's iight boi
They ain't suspicious of jews
I'll show contrition it's cool
Slap on the wrist get ma daddy to choose
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise
Das what I do kid
Happy that my name ain't stupid
Dave coulda been Daquan with a few kids
But now I'm farting overeating at meals
If ain't I gotta theme party Ion't be at goodwill
I'm dentist paying tennis playing smellin on some cabernet
And I ain't gay but if I was everything would be okay look...
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes
But ma premium channels mean tyler perry's never live
Getting tickets they sick I sit at the eagle 45
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive 




Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho
Happy that I'm white but relieved I ain't a chick yo
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up
Or straighten hair I ain't given a damn
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka
They up in heels
And tummy tuckin theyon't grub except for takin them pills foreal...
And ion't bleach shit
Ion't gotta eat dick
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis
Smoking the weed ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing
In disagreements I participate without weeping
And when I'm freaking I'm getting daps high fives and all that
Ma rep goin up and at best ho a slut
So what up
Ya boy cut up
But eat butter
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother... to still love her
And I been getting better looking with age
But a guy can get who he deserves with a horrible face
Seal interlude
I go on dates and never have to worry bout getting raped
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake
And if impregnate I can pack a back and be on my way but good luck girl!




Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man
First off I'm a dude so
There was a one in two chance of that sucking
But now I can run a seven minute mile
I can defend my self adequately
I can be logical
I can get along with my room-mates
Watch serious movies without being scared by them
And the on top of that I'm white
Which is like amazing because
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country
I get my hair cut at a salon
People hold the door open for me which is nice
Er I never have to get into a fight like for social purposes
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people
It ain't about that
It's about me being happy that I'm white know what I'm saying?
But on that note could someone explain to me why Fat Joe and any other person of Hispanic descent is allowed to say the N-word
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense
I've been thinking about that shit a lot
Because like if I could say the N-word lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Yeah
Eh this gon' be the shit that when motherfuckers hear it
They gon' be like 'Damn that dude can rap'
Know what I'm saying?
Like like like like


Look I'm the man bro
Iont really care what the fuck you think
Steak look rare but I grub dat pink
And the grundle stink
And I bump N-sync
Don't suck dick but I blow dat good
Don't want shit but a ho that would
Lemme hold dat bend and fold that
Get a Kodak cowboy Jerry Jones dat lemme own that
Word... fuck that girl

Truth or dare with a cute au paire
Get a room to share hit a boom Pat Burrell
Spit dat turd das dat shit
Gotcha girl up on ma dick
I'm bout to sperm up on dem hips
Don't wanna murder us a kid
Oh shit... whatchu say

Don'tchu usually go with double meat when you eat chipotle
Don't your crew lack someone black but you want one to hang no slave
And I heard your boo got so much back like she bangin' that Notre Dame clock
Faded tho.
Fuckin bitches you'd label undateable
Missing birthdays hay belated brah
Naked out in san fran on that rooftop

Cause I'm the mafuckan man goddamn
And these mafuckas bitches full a shit like zoo mops so


Look you can do it you can say it

Yea I'm jewish so I'm praying das yo boo cause I'm a take her.

Whoa afikoman in a flow das a pro
Whatchu know bout dicky creamin up in hoes
No ho ho
Whatchu know about a balla
Born and raised on the kaballah
Tryna make a dollar until I'm cakin and stackin challa
I'm hollerin atcha daughter like when the fuck you tryna get it
Dat vagina fitted custom for humpin dis little dicky
Puffin' sticky while she bangin' on my wood
Superstitious pussy good
Cooter vicious within a minute I finished
But I ain't trippin off no quick nut
And no pain in the butt ma shit's tough
And ma dick's sucked and yo dick sucks
But real talk I could never give an inch up
We tippin cups in the strip club no flip cup
With a fit butt rubbin on my Nike zip up
No whisenhunt but them bad bitches get cut
Gotta get up so the dick tucked
What the fuck you doin
This that heavy fuckin flow
Word to pads
Wearing out a lotta boxes on the road
Word to plaid
And I gotta have my pops no cereal
Das word to dad
Watching Breaking Bad fucking with' Hank and sippin tab boi.




Yeah I'm saying
If they can say the N word

Do something about it lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Another Friday afternoon
Dicky chillin in his room
Got a teddy on the bed you bet he playing little spoon
Pimpin I ain't fittna move shit
Bitches getting stupid
But I ain't getting hammered less you handing me a tool kit
And yea I know the cool kids are drinkin at the bar
But I just ate a chicken parm
And then got faded in ma car
And there's tomato on ma navel as I'm layin in ma arms
Debating if it's safe to wait because bathrooms kinda far
Goddamn.
I don't wanna go nowhere
Why the fuck these bitches call ma cell
Ion't really care what the fuck they do
I just wanna lay in bed and jerk off ma self
Sun is going down I bet the club been going down
But I don't wanna fuck with nuffin less it's something in the house
And now I'm naked on the couch
With raisenets in ma mouth
I'm playin a stupid asian in NBA 2k12
And I'm beatin that ass with the Utah jazz
Youjizz on the tablet loading multiple tabs
As I pack bowls mac pro chattin with a black ho
Dat want a redskin sack call dat bitch orakpo
Crack flow fuckin with a lotta fuckin snacks bro
Cookies in the oven whatcha know bout how I stack dough


And I ain't got no mafuckan plans ya diggg
It's Friday night and I'm stayin in
Don't wanna drink man you couldn't even pay the kid
Who knew that layin in the crib would make a hit
So put ya hands in the air if you stayin innnn
If you don't even care what day it is
Ya had a long week roll weed take a hit
Go on Demand take a gander and play some shittt


Okay ma cell is getting bombed yo
Bitches want a don
To come meet em greet em leave with em freak em at they condo
Ma penis like Chicago
D Rose pronto
But I won't be scorin less it's fifa with ronaldo
Cause I ain't comin out I'm getting freaky Michael Jackson
Keepin up with the kardashians
As I'm eatin easy mac and
As I'm peein I'm seein penis with pieces of a napkin
Need to clean it I'm creamin without a boo dis ain't Aladdin
Achu das what the rest ya'll do erry time ya'll spit some sicknin shit
The fridge gotta lil bit left in it so now I'm raiden sub zero to finish him
Damn... how you do dat there you kickin it like Liu Kang here
Ma pubic hair super bare whatcha know about a jew with nare
And iont think I wanna brag but stayin inside the pad
Was basically the greatest day that I've had
Holla back if you don't really wanna pregame and wait for cabs
Would rather eat a fuckin cheese cake and take a nap
I'm double bundled up under covers I'm comfy den a mafucka
Bumpin to something usher while grubbing on some fuddruckers
Say I ain't the man ho
Playin on demand shows
You can get retarded lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









See back in highschool
I ain't even know I could rap
So the hits late but nobody throwin the flag
Goin fifth grade with it Dicky opening snacks
Because the kid made different like a joke in Iraq
Now check it


Never thought I wanna pass the bar
But I gotta get fancy car
So I got up on the beat beat on it like
Evander sparring partner smarter art
When I master bars
These weak bitches gotta leave dicky dissin' em all
To listen to y'all is sorta like a flick in the balls
Foreal tho
Cause they don't spit it real as D do
The kid come first like his dick a prequel so look
If you really wanna get it forget it genetically better
Then every pathetic competitor nettin cheddar
Get in bed I'll get you wetter than Redick
I bet I bend her get her beggin etcetera
Breath now ya man on reddit cause I'm rappin the flames
I'm hands on wayne chrebet when I'm mackin the dames tho
The lame bros better learn to make a single
Or ya mayn bout to have these rappers playin some bingoooo... yeah
So whatchu talkin bout
If this really stupid tell me what the fuck is walk it out
If lil dicky ruin rap they poopin on it's coffin now
So if you heard of a jewish rapper you know who they talkin bout
Ion't think I need a grammy bro
I got two and they fairly old
The family demanding ya man be
A little wary tho
They know dude got a scary flow
Just like you do yea
Except they mean it different
Prefer ma chicken white das for chicken and da women
Confessing that I'm hittin only cause I'm nice at spittin
But used to getting used you dudes Aaliyah's kitchen
Hold up the kid so dumb
The drink po up he can't grow up
Ya man gotta thang for donuts
The flow nuts bout to make a jam I go Russ
From Okla - getting more bread than cold cuts whaddup bruh?
That's why these hoes wanna get it
They been fuckin with the kid joe paterno assistant
I'm stern with the women
I'm a a nerd but I'm hittin
On these curves like it's griffey in the third with these pitches
Iight the kids aiight legit polite
I wife nice jews pipe smoove cider with ice cubes
The white dude's known to be recording it right
You jabronies write a stupid chorus lighter than cubes
Commercials
Y'all worse than them
But these lucky bitches they ain't gotta work again
All these chickens in the crib's like a birthed a hen
So I be over-cumming definition circumvent ya dig?
Cold spittin admit it I'm rippin shit up like a ticket stub
And givin a clinic these bitches isn't sick enough to get up in it tho
You should probly quit it bro
Dude's spittin ridiculous with it particularly when he
Be switchin the flowwwww up.
Das cash and all
More black in me than basketball
Next line LD's talkin vaginal
The kid been hittin more walls than a raquet balllll yeaah!

So prepare for my libido
It's really fuckin scary action Bronson in a speedo
It's really fuckin scary magic Johnson near mosquitos
But I'm nearly fuckin there these bitches bout to feed me Cheetos
Cause Ion't really like the mess
Pretty clear right here that the kike the best 
Never scared nor embarrassed ask ma ex
I gotta bone like a freak Kevin Ware the sex... whoa.
Y'all heard about the kid with the jew flow
And jew fro getting mo sugar than glucose
The dude so cold youda so swore he from pluto
Ma head so big it's like I'm juicing with pujols
But look if you thinkin that this jew so nice
Then you so right you rappers lookin' Bruno's type
The dude's so bright I'm rapping like a sumo fight
The knee slappin' unexpected word to Juno's tike lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









I gotta problem with ma dick.
Been hatin on him since I was a kid
Way before I ever put him in a bitch
Goin back y'all
Never wanna trash talk
So I made a track we could rap on
Keep us intact
And I know the fact is that you jewish
But I don't want no excuses for ya size
I know hella jewish guys who grew up between them thighs but no
You actin like you was four
You haven't changed since we young
It's sad you that immature
And I don't get it I'm getting bitches get you in kittens other dicks would die for
But I'm barely hittin it when a minutes ya high score
And now it's real bad
Cause you ain't movin on
You twenty something and still live above ya two balls
I been getting nine to five's but I been keepin us with bitches that was tryn to ride
But you a mafuckin fiend and it's mean we supposed to be a team
You a dick but I wish I had a penis


And this about a dick
Who never took the time to grow
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this
But you gotta stop fucking up ma shit
And I ain't feelin bad
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems
But lay 'em the table maybe we can solve em
Cause you and I we attached at the hip
So we better get this settled up and fixed right now dick


Hold up Dicky you ain't really mean it
You got the nerve to tell me you the one mistreated
I don't believe it it's nuffin but egregious
Cause I'm the one that's been getting beaten
Obscenely in this mafucka right now
Das a fact and ma homies from ma sack'll have ma back
You wackin me every mothafuckin day
You acting like it's okay
But imagine waking up feelin' afraid
I'm prayin you stop abusing but you confused
If you blame me for the ejacs
This about your brain I came because I react
Hope that you concede that
Cause it's on you need to distract
What can I do if you never relax
You see it's actually you that's in control all our faculties
The pre-ejaculatory crap is a sorely inaccurate
Acting like you was deploring me
Warranted insecurity
Scoring ignoring the forming
Of your own immaturity 
And now the prematurity's on ma head
But you know damn well it should be up on yours instead
But if you loved and accepted me then that wouldn't be a problem
Instead I'm in a dick numbing condom


And this about a kid
Who never took the time to grow
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this
But you gotta stop fucking up ma shit
And I ain't feelin bad
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems
But lay 'em the table maybe we can solve em
Cause you and I we attached at the hip
So we better get this settled up and fixed right now kid



Wow I think you need to get a grip dude

I'd say the same but I'm betting that you will soon

Real funny dick I can't even stomach this
How you gonn act like I'm wacking ya shit for nuffin
He frontin up in this mothafucka bluffin on the beat
Wouldn't beat him without a reason he sung it incomplete

Tell me why then.

Why you always tucked in ma jeans
It's cause I'm with a woodpecker like I'm stuck in a tree

Well I confess I'm erect on occasion
But up in the Bahamas -

Hold up we that was a vacation

Is that what you call it as I recall
You was mauling me day and night
Only sex you got was dry aggressively rubbing fly
I was chaffed up. You the fuckin problem dicky wake up

Well what about the time you wasn't stayin up?
I was with a top 5 dime of ma life

Well you the guy that was drinkin all the goddamn wine
Fuck that you a cold crooked mafucka where's your heart

And you a toad looking muthafucka Mario Kart

So this is it?

This is it you a dick I need a penis

No you a dick I need a human being


So this shit about a kid 
Who never took the time to grow
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this
But you gotta stop fuckin up ma shit
And I ain't feelin bad
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems
But lay 'em the table maybe we can solve em
Cause you and I we attached at the hip
So we better get this settled up and fixed lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









It's like these days dicky been up on his grind
Tryna spit a rhyme
Fly enough to get cracker signed
It's aight tho
I been typing all damn night bro
Kikes gotta write raps right no typo
Nice flow
Best up in the game no Michael
I guess I gotta wait for the fame no lipo
But damn if ya man had a hoard of fanbase
I'd have a lot to cover like a corpulent klan face
Go on some man dates
With D'Caprio and Drake
And make a man cave full of chronic and pancakes
A handshake's all I'm really wantin from LeBron tho
Iono
Think I'd rather get up with his mom
And do it delonte couple bottles of Andre
In pompei getting dirtier than some laundry
I'm freakin that ho just for Cleveland man
But first thing I'm a need some fans


Cause little dicky tryna make that cake like a balla do
And denigrate little wayne up at a bar-b-q
And I just wanna hit the floor with pauly D
And cross swords up with Tommy Lee
So where the muhfuckers drinkin the ciroc at
Where the fuck the rock at
Where the bad bitches on this mediocre cock atttt
I'm tryna make the move
From gay lame dateless jew to famous dude ya dig?


First grade and I was thirsty
I was wantin fame up in the muthafuckin worst way
Word play gotta get ya ya boy up on some first take
Skip Bay Steve A get up in they ass ya dig
If I'm celebbin then I'm getting with mccadams's
The hottest women on the muthafuckin planet kid
I'm tryna get up at Selena
Mess around with mila
I remember when it was Christina
Genie up in a bottle but now she couldn't fit up on a waterbed
I wanna score a ten imagine Natalie portman
And if she borin then ill get a ride in ma DeLorean
And go before it securing the whore I been adoring since
I was a teen ya mean
Brittany spears whacha doin
Couple years dat career and dat metabolism ruined
Yain't know about me yet
But the future do
On youtube I been getting some views




Ay enough about a boo ion't need a bitch
But I need a clique
Full a people Derek jeterish
Love the bieber kid
That's a hell of a dude
Well I ain't met him but his documentary was the truth
I'd holla back at snoop drop a couple tracks in the booth
He'd prolly have me high enough to take a nap as I poop
I'm callin kobe Bryant up because I'm fucking with his game
But it's such a shame I can tell that muthafucka lame tho
Flame flow
Ain't nobody even know ma name tho
And all I wanna do is know if channing's really gay tho
All I wanna do is play Durant up in some Halo
Play shows date hoes lyrics

Ridin' round smoking weed with ma foreign bitch
Ridin' round smoking weed with ma foreign bitch
Ma window down I'm riding to ma new shit 

Got ma new bitch got ma got ma new bitch 
Ion't camp off with no j's they sell them hoes for free 
Never payin for no pussy fuck them hoes for free

That's a fucking bawlaa
How can I become a bawlaa?


Mirror mirror on the wall
How can dicky learn to ball
I wish I was TIP and I could spit some shit with southern drawls
I wish I could flip a brick and spit dat shit like Ricky Ross
Holla at broads at the mall

Spit about a mafuckan bitch up in da wip
And getting lit up in the backseat
Talkin shit about a dinner with an athlete
Fuck that can't rap like the rest of these mafuckas
Without all ma writtens being fact free

Do y'all know how bad I wish I could
But y'all would laugh if I spit hood
So now ya man is making jams about some random
Shit when dudes is rappin bout they fuckin weaponry

Homicidal tendencies
The only dough that I can boast about is seeded sesame
I'm jealous B.

Cause errbody in the game get to say they kill
Errbody in the game get to say steal
Errbody in the game sayin words like trill
Really wish that I could make that hit
Fake that shit
Without coming off all gay n shit

Cause if I coulda rapped like wayne
Then I'd prolly be sayin a lot of the crazy shit like
I'm a kill you pussy ass bitches with the chopper
Now make that pussy pop off... and this shit would sound proper


Ridin' round smoking weed with ma foreign bitch
Ridin' round smoking weed with ma foreign bitch
Ma window down I'm riding to ma new shit 

Got ma new bitch got ma got ma new bitch 
Ion't camp off with no j's they sell them hoes for free 
Never payin for no pussy fuck them hoes for free

That's a fucking bawlaa
How can I become a bawlaa?


Here we go
Here's a flow
Bout some shit I really know
I'm a spit it raw and swag it up as if I'm really cold

Ma cheerios is honey nut
Gear at most a hunned bucks
PS I Love You is on the TV dicky tearin up
Go up to the bathroom I have to
Ma dentist say I gotta make an effort now it's time to floss

Hollat ma dog and I call the mafucka to me and
Get a leash and take him out to walk
Roll around the ave
I put his shit up in a bag
And then a wip pull up the windows down this bitch look out and asking

How she get back on the high way
Told dat bitch to drive straight
And take a left on honeycut
But stay up in the right lane
Cause it come up kinda quick

You see what the fuck I'm sayin
Other people get to rap about like
Home cooked crack and like jail n shit
And I gotta spit a lotta shit about a muthafuckin
Kid up in a crib that's got the central air

It's not fair
No one cares
Real talk I just wanna braid ma hair
And rap about whatever bruh
Money hoes etcetera
Instead of bein clever every measure but I'm never gonn be


Ridin' round smoking weed with ma foreign bitch
Ridin' round smoking weed with ma foreign bitch
Ma window down I'm riding to ma new shit 

Got ma new bitch got ma got ma new bitch 
Ion't camp off with no j's they sell them hoes for free 
Never payin for no pussy lyrics

Alrite this the type a shit they be playin at the barbershop

But I ain't stopping till I make it to the top y'all
They bout to feel stupid talking like a dropped call

Cause I'm bout to pop off ma dude the flow too cashy
And this white dude ain't trashy

Got inebriated but ma GPA was still amazing

On that 3.93 tip fuck you know about a
Eastside G spittin uncontrollable

Whatever rapper's getting cheddar I'm the king and they corretta

And I spit that shit so asinine
Been known to jerk ma dick just to pass the time
And I ain't never really care for these fake mafuckas
Take mafuckas cake like I wait on these mafuckas

And you ain't even in ma league lil shawty
I'm a beast you can find me on the beach with a sporty lil young thang
Tan lines out the ass so bad she about to go to Alcatraz

Middle of the week ain't nobody at the crib 
Chillin in the bed with a hard ass dick 
And you Dicky need that
Where the fuck the weed at
Dis about to be a fuckin treat

You can find me tryna beat dick
Lookin for a freak bitch
I ain't fittna pay for it fuckin with dat free shit

Loadin up a page porn hunting like a genius
Baby I make it rain cetaphil up on the penis

Find the kid up on youjizz loadin two vids
Both dem bitches point of view and
Finding new shit can't decide to sort by rating or the view hit
Goin stupid whatcha know about a window full a tabs
And all of them bitches pretty fuckin bad ya dig it

The type bitches gotchu thinkin bout they past 
Could a been a model now a fist up in dat ass 
Bet she wasn't coddled ain't had no a father
So shawty hit the bottle gotta toddler
And needed dollars I swear I hit the lotto with these

Low self esteem having fine ass bitches
Got me loadin got me streaming closing blinds lights dimming
Baby I'm about to blast off
Ballin with my pants off
So if you was lookin for ya man


You can find me in the bedroom beatin on ma dick
Homie I'on't give a fuck I'm just tryna find a clip
Only fuckin with a hi definition type a bitch
That can suck a dick... man this a fuckin hit...


Okay you know I'm searchin jenna haze heather I
Rollin j's and getting high
Almost started creaming seeing mini-skirted haley wilde

Rollin over thumbnails
Lube up in ma thumbnails
Top rated page 21
It's taken me kinda long but I'm scrollin with ma dick out
I roll a little zag yea das word to dan dickau

I'm higher than penthouse
Vagina booty and mouth
You prolly redtube-ing like a pre-pubescant kid out this muthafucka

I'm havin trouble cause her dude is fuckin with rubbers
I know it's subtle but it's covered and if I had my druthers
Then I would need to see the skin touch
Maybe that's a bit much
Either way if you wanna play


You can find me in the bedroom beatin on ma dick
Homie I'on't give a fuck I'm just tryna find a clip
Only fuckin with a hi definition type a bitch
That can suck a dick... man this a fuckin hit...


Last week tried to suck my own dick ehhhh
Don't try n act like you ain't try that shit at least once

But now I'm back jackin dat with a mac
No klan but I stay away from blacks
And ion't take it back I just can't even relate to it
Lookin like a pussy got a porterhouse steak through it

Hate it when a mafuckas dick is as a big as a 4 loco
Type a girth that ain't even of this earth ya dig it

I'm dodging pop ups like a muthafuckin vet in this bitch
The door is locked I got the toilet paper ready and ripped
I'm talkin X-art tan hoes
Bangbros passcodes
So if you was lookin for ya man


You can find me in the bedroom beatin on ma dick
Homie I'on't give a fuck I'm just tryna find a clip
Only fuckin with a hi definition type a bitch
That can suck a dick... man lyrics

Shots in the club like plaxico
I'm in the corner hot like Placido's
And dicky fuckin flow nuts pistachio
And like Shelvin I know how to mack a ho

I got girls on ma penis
Flow is the meanest
Not Gilbert but I'm sellin out arenas
Do it all day A peterson
Because I'm tryna get paid like Revis did

I met a French bitch big lips and she got a body
Told her put that ass on moi like nnamdi
Fight like rocky white like Roddy
Hoosier Daddy all knight like Booby

Hot box ride I can barely see
You know I keep ma car melo like Anthony
Got bigger blunts than legarrete smoke outta Taurus
Put Mar kief in dat philly like Morris

Anybody better better than me good try
I'm the best like Jahvid but I'm not lion
Not even a tyson... no ear biting
Ma pockets fat with green so Rex Ryan

I ball for the bucks like Luc Richard Mbah a Moute
But I'm a fuckin superstar
And if they ask LD where he wanna live
Then I'm a tell 'em where markakis like Nick.

I'm tryna get a little Kevin Love
And then I see a bad bitch starin up in the club

She got an ass so sweet like a cinnabun
I bet dat bitch a giant freak like Lincecum

And so I go and approach her
We kick it like Stover
End of the night I'm a ownher hova

Liquor make a bitch feel raunchy horny
So I'm getting big shots Chauncey horry
Took her back at ma Eddie House
And this fine ass bitch takin off her blouse

And then ma D Rose quicka than a bull at the garden
Dick like James from the way that it Harden
My name ain't Charles but I pack wood son
Ma dick ain't Gretzky but it's still a good one.

She want that juice I ain't talkin bout OJ
It's more like Mayo something like OJ
Okay now her clothes are off
And I can see her C pierced like her name was Paul

I couldn't care less went down feelin the flavor
It was hairless something like Villanueva
Ma Rod Smart so He Hate Me
When I don't cover him up with a safety

But I coordinate that D so I planned protection
Had a Magnum Rolle like louisania tech did
Put a condom on ma Ryan Braun
Ma Hebrew hammer then we got it on

I was playin with a boobie Cavalier
We even made a couple movies Shaq O'Neil
She had a real big cat Andres Gallaraga pussy
But I hit it hard lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Wassup wassup y'all
L-D aka Young Dick

Had to make a track about smoking weed man
Every rapper got a track about smoking weed so I didn't really have a choice
But I guess I made mine a little bit different is all

It's like it's like it's like


Blowin something sticky word to pre-cum dicks
I'm with ma team in this bitch and we all getting lit
I mean the weed hella loud like a teenage chick
And we been smoking for a minute yeah we blowin on that ganja

And now I'm huffin and puffin I'm choking on that bong
And the dope I'm on is bomb I'm smoking that Vietcong

Getting real high
Watching funny videos of bill nye
Tell me that this jam isn't still fly -

Bill nye theme song

Now I'm getting hungry than a muthafucka
Put some chicken nuggets in the oven at 400
Whered I put that honey mustard
Lookin all around the cupboard for that muthafucka
Until I discovered a custard I covered with butter from last week.

How long do them thangs keep?
Guess I better ask jeeves
Go get ma computer but I'm staring at the damn screen

Damn D you forgetting what ya task be
The puff puff pass gotcha gassed
Now ya man is fucked...


And I was tryna get a little buzz so I took a little puff
But I think I'm way too high

And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch so I took another hit
But I think ma brains too fried

And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it
I'm praying that I make it
Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee

I'm too blazed it's too late
To save Dicky from this fuckin place cause he too high


Now I'm freakin out up in this bitch
Can't control it and ma homies passin round another spliff
So I bolted to the BR
Consulted with the mirror

Lil Dicky please step up you pathetic
Cause the weed in you beating you
Then all a sudden I'm on the toilet beating ma penis blue
But I ain't cummin because as I'm imagining fucking something

That pretty girl I'm humping
Becoming my fuckin cousin or mother or brother
Or some other fucking disgusting person

Ma brain is bein strange cause I'm high as a plane
I ain't deranged I'm just saying it's a violent strain
So I go back to the back where they packing up cigars
Dipping snacks kicking back staring at some Avatars

Then I flipped took a decade and a half to make that shit
Yet they couldn't put a second and a half up in that script

How the fuck a human being wanna fuck a
Blueish green 7' 3'' tail having ass thing
Man I'm high as fuckkkk


And I was tryna get a little buzz so I took a little puff
But I think I'm way too high

And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch so I took another hit
But I think ma brains too fried

And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it
I'm praying that I make it
Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee

I'm too blazed it's too late
To save Dicky from this fuckin place cause he too high


Rock hard cock cause I'm watching katy Perry
In her video the whole world's made of candy

Damn... I ain't even got no candy
So now at the fucking c store

Where ya man be torn than a mafucka
Peanut eminems or a twix
Can't commit so I count the benefits on ma hands

Goddamn now I'm weary of the man - yeah the cashier
Homeland Nazir!

S-s-s-so damn tweaked I can't even cross the mothafuckin street
Gotta wait until that muthafucka's green

Now I'm back up at the crib and I'm laughin at giraffes long necks
Gotta shit but the path to the bathroom is complex
Crafted a long text took about an hour
Took a scary shower now I'm sitting naked on the ground

Man I'm fucked up. I'm bout to call ma mom up and tell her what's up.
This sucks I'm high as fuck.


And I was tryna get a little buzz so I took a little puff
But I think I'm way too high

And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch so I took another hit
But I think ma brains too fried

And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it
I'm praying that I make it
Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee

I'm too blazed it's too late
To save Dicky from this fuckin place lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Friday fucking night
We bout to do this right
Dicky rollin to the club he about to find his wife

Cause he fresher than a kid that called his mom a fuckin ho
Bunch a bitches getting low
Pimpin you already know

I'm bout to get up on the flo and then bring chicken to ma crib
Getting drunk up in this muthafucka fuck you think this is?

Then I see a bad bitch with a booty and a half
I make a move on that cutie excuse me do you wanna dance

Then she looked at me and laughed
Like I didn't have a chance
Like I shouldn't even asked
So I proceeded to get trashed

And I'm at the bar now and it's so loud
But I'm takin shots and I'm throwin down
And I see a pretty lady so I send her some of that cold brown

And she turned around and then turned it down
Because in her words she don't like to flirt with clowns
And I'm alone and pouting overcrowded I need to get up out this club


I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones

None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but gone


Bout to quit but I'm bitter I paid that cover
So I guess I gotta stay in this stupid club a bit longer
And I'm sweating like a jew in a multicultural sauna
They been playing fuckin dubstep for ten consecutive songs

And then I bumped into a guy
He was roughly 6 foot 5
Pretty sure it was his fault but I apologized

Pretty sure you know the type probly bankin every night
Vodka sprite lookin round to find a kike that he can fight
Or suckerpunch I'm kinda drunk and I been in the club for way too long
Now I'm up in the corner all alone ESPN up on ma phone

Ma self esteem is so depleted such a mess I'm overheated
I regretfully just tweeted some depressing shit I need to leave this club


I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones

None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but gone


Is this really for the bathroom are you kidding?
This the type of line where people squeeze they dick to prevent pissing

When I get inside the stall it's like a yeti had been shitting
And there's piss all on the ground so as I'm wizzing I keep slipping

Fuck this hand stamp
Club is really damn cramped
Fuck it I'm a suck it up and take another damn chance

Ughh here goes nothing 

Ay girlie what's the word
At first glance I may look like a nerd
But if you let me bet D get thee all up in the bed so wet like a mafuckan jetski

Real rap if you tryna go then put your name right here up inside ma phone
She took bait no way typing out her home she pressed save
Walked away lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Iont fuck around
I been getting down
Not afraid to eat some triscuits up off the ground

5 second rule?
I'm on that 5 year
A lotta guys fear what I got in my ears 

If I ain't pissin then you know I'm shittin bricks
Do it sick when I finish homie I ain't washin shit
Shaved dick shave with same shit face get
Bitches sittin on ma pillows and they butt naked

Lickin grease off of that pizza
And these mafuckas prolly want a paper towel
Errybody know that I rape toenails
When I pick then I flick em on the straight up ground now

Ain't shit to a mafuckan balla
Mo grit than a mafuckan dolla
Come back from ballin you gotta smell sack
Yea it's that appalling

And Ion't ever wash ma feet
When I'm in the shower they be hard to reach
When I'm getting down goin out on the weekend
I'm asleep before I brush my teeth

I'm a goddamn G tho
Mo grime than Ed Reed's pee hole
Mo grime than Ronaldhino
These other rappers can't deny it


Cause I don't even act like a thug
But I'm cold enough

I ain't moving crack holdin guns
But there's more than one dimension to a balla

You can find ya boy around the way
Being scummy and fucking grubby you know I'm tryna say

That I'm grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch 
Grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch 

It take a slimy muthafucka to be grimy as a grundle
So you in trouble if you attempt to try to be as gutter as the kid


Eating wings
Beating off
Dick stings from the muthufuckan hot sauce 

Came nuts... no tp
Lazy so I rub it on the damn sheets
Ya man D on that reggie evans shit
Boogie pickin boogie flickin hella belly button lint

Fuck a bitch and I'm wetter than a muthafuckin swish
Yeah I'm sweating more than CC bases loaded bottom 6

I'm eating mixed nuts with my mouth wide open
At bar a bar where them house flies float
Iont give a fuck if it flush if I must urinate
Not a place up in the house I wouldn't go

I sink piss and I sniff clothes
Nastier than Kimbo
And I lick snow
When it's yellow
And I sleep at the hotel on

That old blanket that yo mamma used to never let you touch
I just don't give a fuck I'm nasty like the nut of johnny kruk
I do the dutch oven to maself
Fuckin with the way it smells
So if someone sicker well then tell me


Cause I don't even act like a thug
But I'm cold enough

I ain't moving crack holdin guns
But there's more than one dimension to a balla

You can find ya boy around the way
Being scummy and fucking grubby you know I'm tryna say

That I'm grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch 
Grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch 

It take a slimy muthafucka to be grimy as a grundle
So you in trouble lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








What it do
Was 22 up in the room
Thinkin bout a way that I could make a move
Make a boom
Debated to move to LA
To make it in movies
But traded the pool shade and gravitated to music

Now I'm spittin the hottest shit
It don't matter the competition
Is sadder than a bladder that be lackin a pot to piss in

It's actually kinda sicknin
The rap is beyond horrific
Admit it bruh waka flaka flame is somehow respected?

The game has gotta change used to listen to jay
Up on the train now they floodin the waves with 2 chainz
I feel like I separate with ma lines like 2 lanes
It's a dark knight when the joker's better than them banes

Of the rap game all of 'em rap lame
They claimin all em ballin well then all of em sac kings

At least they in the league tho
I can't even cop a fuckin peacoat
That's why I'm aiming outside the box like it's a free throw

The weed smoke fuckin the air up
Got this mothafucka snackin more than Miggy Cabrera
Got dis mafucka rappin some crack and yappin about it on his cell phone
Tell holmes this is the track that I got ma swell on

And I spit that shit so fast sometimes I need to slow it down
All these bitches up in the crib it's like ma home a pound

Tell me I ain't hold it down
Spittin ridiculous ticklin bitches
Up into they britches and rip em like tickets

And fastballs lookin at a cutie on the dance flo
I visualize that booty with the pants off
Had a little dance off
And I ain't had no shot it was the ass fault
Cause shawty body arguably hotter than august asphault

They claimin they great man these rappers straight lebroning
I'm layin in wait to smack the fuck up out dat spalding
I'm hatin every song they celebratin poppin dom
But I be takin shots a brandy like a kobe at the prom pic

Bomb shit ya'll should see ma muthafuckin blonde bitch
The bombs on dat body shawty just gotta be Islamic
I twist and I turn her on till she wet like she a faucet
No rapper give you more a set... isn't it ironic?

Because I'm seein these labels
Pumpin out the horseshit got me callin em stables
Pumpin out the tours quick but they ain't makin hits
Ain't nobody great as this
White boy killin brothers on that cane and abel tipppp

Tri tip steak up on a plate I'm on a date
With a dime bitch nibbling cake
But nevermind that
Someone tell me where the fuck the rhymes at
I was bumpin nas in his prime and you gonn sign that?

Oh well guess I'm better than they'll ever be
I could do it serious but they prefer the levity
I ain't really hearin nuffin
Say I ain't the man
I'm layin in sand zero spf for the tan

But now I'm back in this muthafucka spit hotta than a flame throw
Waitin to hear em call on ma name like rap a game show

Tell me this is lame
Though I know that is bogus
Gotta focus
Be the dopest
With the most set of quotes and the grossest
When I flow sick and the hope is

Notice is right around the corner my time to shine
Is almost aligned something like a quarter to nine

If I could have a quarter for the metaphors in my rhymes
I'd only have a couple dollas so I'm stickin with dimes ya know?

They getting off like a train stop
I'm lookin at ma dick like how the fuck do you stay rock
No southern carolina how you got so much game cock
Cause you movin that vagina in the dark like a stage prop

It's all good
I'm making this the outro
I had to fuckin spit this is what I'm about bro
And you know what it is holla back up at the kid Slim Boner
So damn hard lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








Now look at all these muthafuckas out on Pride Rock
Lotta livestock
Think it's cause Sarabi ride cock or she did once
Cause they celebrating Simba
Lil cub errbody gotta kneel cause

Deal was lions was some muthafuckin real thugs
And the fear of being turned into a meal was
Such a fright yo but on the real they hella nice tho
This specific pack of lions acting like some white folks

But Africa is full a brothas one is Uncle Scar
And that muthafucka wasn't nuffin funny son he hard
And he mad too
Cause he just wanna be the man too
First it was his brother now another king is brand new

Baboon drawin on a tree ya dig
There's something freaky bout rafiki bet his weed legit
That muthafuckin monkey doesn't need comedians
The reason is he laughin at the breeze and shit it's weird

Alrite now back to the plot
Mufasa was a wonderful father he loved him a lot
And Simba wanted to impress him every second he got
The youngn was taught... but then one afternoon he forgot

Thas when he holla'd at nala to follow da balla
To crawl up in da squalor
Where all uh da lawless acknowledge his father

But they never gave a fuck bout a little bitty pup
Aw shucks... they gonn eat this mafucka up
Until his dad came through and smacked dem bitches in the head
Coulda had em dead but he let em runaway instead

Now he really mad at dude
He cute when he sad tho
And the simple truth Simba doin what his dad do

Shit... now das some real talk homie.
But he can't own them fields with dem lil paws homie
And real dogs only bark at bitches when they gotta do
Taught him to think when he at the line like an audible

And now the part I abhor
Lil Simba chillin with a chameleon perfecting his roar
Could a been a gecko but dat shit echoed effectin the gorge
Was accidental but you know what's in store the stampede scene
Shit... and he was all up on a stick gotta hold a grip
Simba you done got up in some shit

But his dad came through and he saved him man
But as he climbed with them wounds Mu raised his hand
But dude his brother on some muthafuckin scar face
Scar face lit up like a muthafuckin star'n space

Hard place and a rock mufasa caught up in between that
Das his brother but that brotha was a mean cat
And when he threw him off the ledge
Simba couldn't believe dat that muthafucka dead

Tears being shed
Scar got up in his head
More dread for da boy so he ran away and fled

Timon and pumba time
The young cub grown up what a beautiful lion
They grub bugs cub's nuts hittin puberty while
The voice of change up - ferris buller style ya know

And they was tryna eat a beatle
A lion came through tryna dine hella regal
Then pumba got stuck bout to get his ass cut
But then Simba stepped up and defended like a thug do

Rollin round he realized who it was too
Hollad back at nala like whassup boo
Hugged smooth
Confused
Nala lookin pretty titties done grew
Butt cute
He bout to fuck soooooon

Then he nuzzled from the back
And he cuddled from the front
He was really mackin jawn
She all up on his junk

You could see me jackin off to scene believe dat
The young me fuckin around with cats I need that
To recap lotta feedback Simba react
The fam need dat... but ya man can't be back

He just wanna do his thing ya dig
But he the king
Even tho he wadnt feelin it

Until he met up with the monkey
What a funky fuckin junkie
But he spunky told the muthafuckin lion bout his country

And he ran back
Pride rock got it's man back
But damn... the whole land hella ransacked

And then he saw scar with his mom
Sarabi lookin hella worn hidden Simba looked on
As scar did her like a dog hit her hard with his palm

Forreal dog?
Alrite you fuckin with the God now
Long growl
Pimpin' handle bidness like a boss now
Tossed down
Talkin shit to Simba bout to cost clown

Scar tell the young'n that he killed his pops tho
Foreal mafucka? He revealed his hops bro
And clocked on that muthafuckin sucka with a cross
Rocked uncle with couple then sunk him with a toss

He on't play that shit... brothas and lacrosse
Real talk... the dogs done finished him off
And pride rock was back where it started at
The meals back fields packed with the hardest cats

Foreal jack... the animals is feelin dat
The real is back... and I just spit the realest rap lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Looking at a bitch it's a beautiful view
Snookie kinda tits with a booty for two
But she really fit word to Scooby and Doo
So I pursue it like I do in the booth
That mean I really wanna hit holla at her like ayo what it do
I ain't your daddy I ain't mad at you moves
The way you dancing got me staring cause you badder
Than a bear at the zoo
Who doesn't care particularly for the food
And get embarrassed when there is a lot of people staring into his lair
And he very hairy and the air isn't good
She said okay I'm understanding the comparison
So chill with the narrative cause you scaring me away from you dude
Then I said I said okay that was my bad
Know my pick up line's sad
Wanted to impress you why the fuck you think I buy plaid
We should go to my pad
Let you hold the iPad climax
You looking better than an imax
Decide fast cause I'm bout to get up in the the ride and take a ride fast
She replied yes now we driving
And now she kissing on ya dude
But the minute she unzippin's when I think I gotta poop


Now your man is rolling all around the motherfucking city
While he holding on a bitty


While he holding in a shit
He can't control it so he focused but she groping on his dick
He wanna bone her but he told her that he feeling sorta iffy
But she really wanna get it bro
Feeling on a testicle
But Lil Dicky reeling what he feeling is intestinal
Goddamn it what the fuck should I do
Cause shawty really wanna get in the mood
But Dicky been had to poop
And now she kinda confused
Been persistent but the kid been tryna resist her moves
Doing 60 in a 20 I got reason to move
Cause I been squeezing on my buttcheeks like a prisoner do
And now I'm getting close to panicking
Stomach is unraveling
Every fucking bump has got me clutching on my abdomen
I swear this isn't happening
I'm staring at the back of the Cadillac in the passing lane
Swearing up at the traffic mayne...
Man this is harder than all madden
I'm airing out the car because I'm farting like a savage
She started fucking grabbing on ma part to make some magic
But I'm hardly harder than some corduroys up on a rabbit
So I tell her that the plans change
Don't mean to act strange
But I gotta go I left ma phone up in the last place
She gave me the sad face
Started typing numbers at a fast pace
Glowing black case on the dash great
So I told her thanks babe
But I forgot I gotta water fucking plants up at my aunts house that way
But shawty still up on your man
She caressing and undressing me and then I shit ma pants


Now ya man is rolling all around the motherfucking city
Trying hold in that he shitted cause he rolling with a bitty


But he tripping and he twitching cause he hoping she don't sniff it
But he only got a minute till she notice that he did it
So he pull over the car and
Do it like he Tarzan
Rip all of his clothing then go into the forest
Minute later shawty came in the nude
And then I laid her on a sycamore root
Nobody knew that I pooped
Nobody know that I pooped
Fucking right nobody knew that I pooped
Until I got back in the wip up with that chick
And she could sniff all the poop and
So then I told her that it must have been goose
She said I think you mean geese
I said that's what I mean
Seen a dozen of them motherfuckers in the ravine
Then she said what's a ravine
I said the thing in between us and all the greenery
I mean it's a stream don't know why I said ravine
Then she said oh I see lyrics

I'm the biggest pussy rappin all day
I'm a represent it lovin me some rent on broadway

Call it gay but fuck it it's really lovely
To come up in really comfy pajamas
With a mama and knowledge of commas and college

But all these other rappers think thuggin is cool
These mafuckas so redundant with the drugs in the jewels

But I ain't buggin... ma stomach getting sun by the pool
I'm with a mexicano jawn straight getting azul

Foreal tho
Real flowin jabronis is still frontin with it
Real open spittin ma dick is a mere couple inches

Meals made of truffle
Ma kitchen is real troublesome
I'm real good at hugging and snugglin lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








I heard this shit on workaholics
And this for errbody bout to finish college
It's only right that I drop a little knowledge
Cause life ain't like it outta be

I thought it'd be a lotta women callin me
And sodomy and drinkin like it's all for free
Illogically I never thoughta poverty
Or how this muthafucka's muthafuckin job would be

But ever since I go the cap and gown
Errybody cracking down nappin now
Erry fuckin snack got me packin pounds

Wearin fuckin slacks got me scratching da back uh ma sack
And rap is not exactly a faculty rapidly rackin me
Anything but apathy for those who be naggin and draggin me
Into the wackest meetings holding me back from eating
The saddest fucking lunch I pack and bag in the evening
Ma bank is depleted I even have to think before tweeting

Man it's really fuckin sad when thinking bout
The evolution from the past to drinking now
We used to go and split a handle drink it down
Then hit the town and hit the hottest chicks around

But now? I can barely slug a half a dozen tops
Used to chug a lot now I'm fuckin buzzin off a shot whoa

Clubbin wasn't nuffin to me boy
Used to walk up in that muthafucka stuntin like whassup I wadn't coy
Ain't nobody gave a fuck if I'm employed

Errybody drunk and fuckin lovin it rubbin and huggin
Mugging chugging and fuckin but now these bitches
Is up on some other shit wanting a husband
Clubbin got me buggin and blushing cause I'm a young'n das confronted
With a hundred abundantly rugged and coveted funded muthafuckas it's humbling

Think about the age range
They get to date way older and emotionally open homies goin gray
Now I'm up on first dates
Sober like it's first grade
Hoping when it's over that I close it with some first base shit

Ma face getting fuckin fat
It's April hateful fillin fuckin taxes out

Long ass days getting blazed and tappin out
Back is naggin now mac is laggin now

Because I bought it back in college
So if you comin lemme run a little knowledge
If you was wondering if fun isn't acknowledged
Well Wednesdays lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Cause if you really talkin' shit bruh
I suggest you take a sec and recognize ma shit raw
I been texting pictures atcho sister be ma in law
You know I been spittin' vicious whatchu fittin' to get at ma dude
I been killin' bitches Michael Vick in the booth
The US see me I be kiffin to you
I gotcho bitch up on ma stick she ride it sick
Like it was quidditch but nude
And I'm the honorary Gryffindor Jew
And I don't care about ya bitch or ya ya ya riches or ya wips bro
Even tho you fictional I'm guessing that you get dough
No you don't exist but I see through you like a window
Dicky run this shit and you'sa cripple
Fuck it though you dumber than Waka Flocka
Be sonnin you like a father
D bomber than Osama plot
And smart as Obama
Gotcho lil mama in the sauna all up
In the male locker room
She really good with the D
That's my Serge Ibaka boo ooh
Das dat dude spittin hot as Rihanna
You softer than llamas
Do prima donnas faster than ramadan
I'll be honest getting commas in ma wallet
Is nada ebonically smarter the kike
Been flowin nice as the Dalai Lama
Whaddup bruh
I'm goin stupid cause I'm better
This the hottest shit like I was pooping in a sweater
Ain't nobody do you anymore you a letter
You get it write? That was clever
Ho'
But look


If you think you on ma level jabroni
Than let me educate you bet you need a fellowship homie
Lil dicky rippin dat ribbon cause what he spittin' is winning
So if you finna be some chicken for dinner
Then hollaback up at the kid boy
I'm spittin' good up in this bitch ho
So if you wanna get at me you better get a Mento ahhh
That's word to ads from the past
Ya ass up in a jam if you come at the man
Then yon't stand a chance


Das retard flow
I been talkin game on campuses I'm Lee Corso
Battle me he'll be like  see Argo
Package all up in this dude caboose... free cargo
Fuck it. I'm really talkin that shit
I'm coming at a muthafucka that don't even exist
But if we under the assumption that he
Someone dat spit it redundant to someone incumbent
Then he dumber than bricks ya dig?
Listen to these bitches making hits and
You'll see the horrendousness dat be existing
Every minute some kid is diminishing a single
Written like a semi-retarded kid in kindergarten
Except he harder than me so poor Lil Dicky is stuck
Watching stupid muthafuckers
Make music and caking foolish
While jewish muthafuckas rate movies
Okay cupid to do a lil fuckin
But if it's bout the rap lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics

Stay with eminems... like ya man's kai pfaifer

Every song is getting bomber like a mall in isreal
And I been buzzin like I'm chugging alcohol with no meal

Da sickest shit and killin criminal's spittin so

You know where I be at
If you didn't know about the kid then lemme recap

Baby I been all around the fuckin world
Huggin da girls
These muthafuckin bitches lovin the curls

The kid been takin his vacation days and
Makin bacon basically takin the game and changing
It to make it relatable

Trader joes up in the fridge boi
Unprotected sex without no kids boi
Makin sure ma lady take dat pill boi

Gotta keep it real
Honesty about to get ya boi a deal boi
Comedy in songs fuck da kill joys

But like


Man I wish I could sing good

But until this shit get around then it's all ya dude
Up in his room getting down but it's all for you

So like
Shoot
If you know somebody that produce
Or a hottie that'll sing about her boobs
Hit me up on gmail tho yo
Cause I been tryna take dis shit to retail bro
And I don't know have any contacts


Alrite I'm back up in this bitch
Spittin crack up on the track
Up on the mac up in this bitch

Cause the rappin that's crackin em up is actually legit

Literally every regular person get up on ma credit level
Better than your better will ever be spittin incredibly
Ready I'm a get on that melody with dat real shit

But I'm still attacking every track and I been killin

Lil dicky bullshitting and good livin with good writtens
So good riddance to every rapper acting so cool with it
I school bitches lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Man I wish I was a kid
Thinking bout the third grade
Back in '96 in my Michael Jordan jersey
French fries curly cool with it raising Tamagachis
Dick 3 and a half the same as a floppy
Nerf guns loaded and we shootin at y'all motherfuckers
We ain't getting hoes but we getting soda
And we was fucking with the swag of The Fresh Prince
Ain't nothing like when you had mad tokens left
In that arcade balling
Watching tickets falling
Pegging stupid bitches in the motherfucking ball pit
Landline calling
Chilling at the mall
And if this the type of shit that you recall well then


Let me hear you shout
If you grew up in the 90's
Then you know what I'm about
Don't you wish we could rewind it
I wish we could man I really miss it
Cause we having fun all day
Slept all night
Best ten years of our whole damn lives
Blowing on a cartridge a lot of fucking farting
I would give it all up if I could restart it


Sitting on the school bus
Flipping through some Goosebumps
A minute 'til I'm shitting out the school lunch
Wanna know what cool was?
Starter jackets Jock jams and Pop Rocks
Sega in my room baby boom shaka laka
Lot of slammers in my pocket flippin them pogs
And I knew every modem noise in ma aol login
On that Oregon Trail
With Keenan & Kell
I was jerkin off daily TRL
But that Saved by the Bell
Was on some fuckin hot shit
OJ to jail oh wait that glove did not fit
Short shorts Stockton
Beanie Baby profits
And NBA on NBC if you remember watching




Remember getting greeted with Scholastic mags
I hated it reading but it made me need that shit so bad
And we was spinning that bottle de-prude hoes
Winning full throttle Nintendo
Switch the flow up getting donuts
Fruit roll ups wishing we could be a grown up
Being so dumb fucking with the kid call me Lil Dicky Griffey
And my koosh balls big lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Wasup ya'll? let me preface this by saying this is not a Mac Miller diss by any means
I actually like mac miller butt but right now he probably is the most popular rapper excluding Eminem
And I'm just not even close so you can understand why I would rap over one of his beats
I got a little bit of Kobe in me and if Kobe saw Lebron he would wanna rap over one of his beats
Metaphorically speaking I know he ain't Lebron butt but you get what the fuck I'm saying
Maybe he's more of a Jo Johnson type of shit no disrespect

Fuck... this undergrad bitch tryn fuck
And her chest deserves an A like she handle da puck
She know D been bumpin Drake like ya man a Canuk
Homie even if it's May in LA... I'm so fuckin cold

Roll good on that Westside
Hoes cook like they country thick
So hood up in Best Buy
Controller D punkin kids

Loading up the used dishes
Rollin up with two bitches
Hope they old enough
To get folded up I'm not bold enough to do prison

I been drinkin sippin something so horrific ya dig it
Because I tipped the bartender extra then he put extra liquor
In dat shit. Goddamn. Das a misinterpretation
Hate it when they stiff. Overtipping cause I'm caking

Take in errything a mafucka say
Been about rap figured out that from the basement
I ain't talkin bout rap city on black entertainment
Talkin bout the place I was raised in
Plate full uh bacon
Making a bagel and bake on occasion

Back then woulda made rap for grades
Now a mafucka make rap for pay
And them bitches too
Chickens that I'm bangin so appealing
They been Shagging on ma balls like they practicing they fielding and

I Sorta make em pop off
Make em take they socks off
Round the fuckin bases then get pounded like a walk off

Aw naw...
This a fucking statement I'm making
They been hesitating to give lil David space at the table
Cause they label a capable able jew gay and too playful
Watching cable naked the AC blowin major like slater's dad

Why you hater's mad?
Maybe I should get a couple tats
Maybe I should get in trouble and be dumbin down the rap

Look at Mac
White as fuck but lookin thugger than a trap spot
Need another mac 'stead of luggin round this laptop

Blackballed
From the muthafuckin rap blogs
Cause I rap odd never talkin bout a fuckin black card
Ion't gotta play da black card cause I rap hard
Ion't think it mean I gotta act hard

Fuck it tho
Despite dat LD straight fucking hoes
Ma chickens stay hot no buffalo
Ma hand been up in her bod no muppet ho

Whatcha know bout a mafuckin kid up with a job
Coulda fit in with the mob had a kid and a garage
But I didn't now I'm spittin like a mothafuckin slob
Doin shit up in garageband better than the gods of the game do

Ya'll better know ma name soon
I ain't no clown when you laughin out loud
Don't forget you getting down to a great tune

Make room

Yeah I'm fuckin funny but this muthafuckin dog spit

But before I get dat Emmy I'm a make you bitches sorry that I'm gone


Yeah and once again no disrespect to Mac Mac I actually follow you on Vine I'm fucking with you it looks like your having a pretty ridiculous amount of fun
Sometimes your at a pool sometimes your smoking weed and rapping
Would love to be a part of it if vine is any indicator your life is awesome
Okay I got to go to work lyrics

Yeah fuck you think you dealin' with
Every time ya hear da the kid you know he bout to kill dis shit
Every rhyme is sicker than an ugly bitches period
You know the Jew is building something I ain't talking pyramids
Them bitches with titties they wanna get up at the kid
They instant messaging Dicky they wanna get up on his dick
But I ain't ready to hit it because I'm relatively timid in the bed I admit it
But fuck that gay shit we should fuck soon
Baby whatchu wann do
Tell me when to come through
Take you out to ritas then I'll skeet up where dat tongue blue
D could tweet a freak till I'm peekin' up at a cheek and that physique'll
Have me jackin' ma D if I don't agree to meet at her at her fucking condo
Eat it like a combo
Need it in the mourning or I'm heated like Alonzo
You know that the geek about mack up an actress
Imagining McAdams all on ma mattress
Attackin' ma sack and attractively crackin' ejaccin' we nappin'
The fuck you think you doin'
I'm rappin' some crack and I'm lackin' the practice cause the Jew
Dat's been smackin' the track up and snappin' has actually been doin'
This shit renewing the spit for one year
Fuck it tho
Think you better read about ma fuckin' flow
I'm smoking weed with clueless bitches cheatin' playin' suck and blow
Eatin' on some buffalo chicken fingers on a boat
Went from being honor roll to spreadin' like he on a roll
Haha... Whoa
Okay now I'm on a roll
Scoring got em screaming commentators speaking on a goal
Tourin' writing TV getting greedy but I'm honorable
I swear dat Dicky isn't that conceited but I think it's time to
Roll another spliff and we blowin' that
Salt and vinegar up in the whip yea I'm holdin' that
Bitches droppin' back up in shotgun like they was Flacco or Rodgers
I'm doin 60 so I tell em to stoppit I need to concentrate
The hoes know DI been goin' MIA
I'm in the four door Fiat lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Hey what's up y'all?
It's ya boy Dicky AKA Yung Dick
A$AP Rocky beat
A$AP fuckin' witchu
If you tryna like get on a track collaborate I'm with it
Or like
Even if it's like just getting brunch
I get brunch if you wanted to
I don't know if you get brunch but you should
My treat
So alright hold up


Yo
Riding through ya city tryna find some titties
I'm high enough to think I might be dying word to Whitney
Vagina chicken sticky that's all you gotta give me
And I'm bout it bout it ain't no doubt about it
Lil dicky ehh?
Heard he spit that witty ridiculously offensive shit
Heard he got expensive shit heard that he resent his dick
You heard right muthafucka
I'm a a bright coy white boy kike muthafucka ehh?
So whatchu fittin to do
I got a bitch she brought a bitch now ma dick dinner for two
Okay das fiction but admit it that I'm spittin it smooth enough
To get a jew with some scruff to mack a beauty with boobs and a butt
And plus a flat ass navel twistin' that no dreidel
From the back so fable of me 
Cream cheesin philly bred - so bagel of me
When dicky dead this is never gonna be... so




And I been rollin with a fatty
Boneless chicken patties
Been clubbin like this muthafucka's rollin with a caddy
And now that I been rappin all these bitches holla me
Had to put a daily cap on the head no Aladdin
Know I'm average looking and I'm bragging bout getting chickens
But this spitting got me positioned to be banging out bitches
Outta ma league... Jeff Teague bangin on Griffey
Would never happen less you happen to be hanging with dicky
Oh yeah I'm white killin brothas like I'm up in the klan
Been fucking fly faced honeys like I'm up in sudanm so damn!
I'm a spit it till I get a buggatti
And body two hotties who bodies
Fugazi punanis tsunami - das wet
Puffin sticky you ain't fuckin with lil dicky
Bumpin biggie lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Drinkin' up at summer camp
Itchin' on ma underwear
Dicky got a ton a hair
Money talk rap game Chris Tucker here
Erry' muggle fuckin with' me
Going nuts word to chunky Jiffy
Cold cuts up in the Panini
Mo butt than a Puerto Rican I been tryna freak too
Nowadays Dicky tryna get a little freak to
Nominate Dicky dick for a little free poon
Honestly probably rather have a little sweet boo to let me spoon
Fuck it I'm conflicted
Now that the kid been spitting dat
All types a women starting to listen and part of Lil Dicky sorta wishing
For a chick I can build with start to finish
But an even bigger part of me is tryna fuck
All these twitter bitches pictures looking fine as fuck
Been a girlfriend guy for a while and shucks
This the first time dimes been in line to stuff
But I ain't doin' em all or doin' em raw
Da boy ain't new to the ballin'
Viewing it all just like
A straight Jew at the mall with loot in the wallet
The restraint engrained up into the ball
But I ain't blue in the balls tho
Got a lil' boo up in law school
Freckles all up over her nostrils
She doing me proper lotsa pasta shots of vodka
Tonsil soccer pop then it's off to clasa hasta manana
Being weird again
There he go Kanye being weird again
It's okay he allowed cause he legendary
But I don't really know how to treat this segment


Sippin' on an Orangina
Bout' to see a foreign feature
Skittles and a quarter reefer
I snuck em both inside the theater
Used to do a ton of math
Now I'm close to doing none of that
I'm bout to hire someone's dad
And he about to do a ton of math
Add it up rapping crack gon' stack it up
Back it up ho das whassup
Cracker jacks at the bank
Cole Hamels up drank a cup and I'm kind of buzzed
I'm high as fuck but fuck that
Where them bitches sitting 7th inning finna fuck at
Used to fuck with bitches that was timid with the nutsack
Now I'm fuckin' bitches let me jizz up on they buttcrack
Das a fun fact I'm
Head of ma class and ready for mine
And like a great red in a glass I'm better with time
I mean I came letterman jacket ready to shine
They up designer shit
I'm in footie pajamas bitch
Omelettes bomb as shit
The rhyming sick
Competish can't conquer dis'
I'm legit honest chicks is on ma dick
I ain't a God but... you can call me Deezus
Switch to beat up
Ye I see ya
Bout to make more tortillas
Pork carnitas
Going straight North Korea
Poor Aaliyah
Sorta Lena
Y'all dudes more Madea
Touring writing rapping lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Iight I'm blowing on that sticky shit
Everybody's talking bitches stalking quick as Lawson
When I'm walking to the gym and shit
Everybody wanna get involved with the Dicky kid
I don't even know the deal y'all I'm just killing shit
I ball like I'm playin the wii
Hit up all da ATMS I been paying the fees
Being gay about the stems Dicky weighing the weed
And now these labels on a cleanse got em saying
We need jews oh the dude the scoop boos
Boozing stupid and he rap bruising tunes amusing students
I'm the truth dude
Put some funny shit up on youtube
Now these mafuckas spitting looking shitty as doo doo
Who knew ya dude got a lot to do
I don't fill them bitches up but the lobster do
Plus she licking on my nut like it's pasta too
And now that Dicky blowing up all these bitches so compliant
These days dicky gotta cover up his privates
Bathroom pissing brothas buzzing on some spy shit
Man I wish that my dick was a little bigger
Because I'm in a pickle for riddles about ma pickle
Being minimal criminally abysmal and literally
Women I'm hitting is cognizant of every centimetre
And I'm meeting bitches who seem to be fucking Derek jeter's
Every weekend very freaky don't know what I'm doing to em
These bitches do the type of shit chicks in porn doing
Bathroom beating on my dick right before I do 'em
Man that's my only chance ya know
I'm handsome though
I gotcha lady dancing bro


Man ever since I came up in this motherfucker shit been changed
Every rapper getting madder 'bout the funny shit I'm saying
They be trapping I be napping steady crapping on the game
And like a rabbit out the hat I'm doing magic with the flames man


Better stop comparing me to Andy Milanokis
Andy Samberg Adam Sandler man I swear it's so obnoxious
I don't care about the rarity of care-free song topics
The hilarity and parody is not what's got you noddin when I write
On the mic spit nothing like a white kid
Black bitches even fucking with me cause I'm nice with
Raps booty big as shit I'm in it but she quite thick
Crap from this angle I can barely fit the pipe tip
Like da the white man bright and me don't bite
And me won't fight me done watch da dark knight with a cold sprite
And me so kike kite runner up on da cold night
And me done scrub de body with ton of the old spice




But fuck it
My buddy got a crib Nantucket
And everybody here with a bitch straight fucking
And everybody here know the kid stay bumpin'
My YouTube Smith up on the Knicks they subbing... aww.
I just checked up in yo bitch's pussy up on 4square
Mini golfing oh so often you woulda swore I toured there
Break 'em off up in my office you know I record in there
It's boring there so fuck it
I been caking don't mistake me for some rapper you hating
I'm actually making the hottest fucking tracks in the nation
Like Satan somehow created some elaborate gymnasium
Packing bowls in stadiums came from packing the bowl in basements
Name a rapper in the game spit a flame like you boy can
Everybody know I got it made like a boyband
Everybody know I'm getting laid like a Troy fan
I stay with Trojans on ma shit lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








Man I ain't even into being curt dude
But ma head blowin up like I'm the kurt dude
And my friends getting hung up like a shirt do
Now they ain't the only homies fuckin with da burd dude

This for all ma homies lookin like a nerd who
Got a tennis serve and never broke a fucking curfew
I been getting ready for confetti from the first boo
Game 6 I ain't bout to finish like the spurs do

Now they tryna get ya guy a deal
Cause the flow cash money got a tyga feel
All these majors coming at me like I'm tiger healed
But ion't think the labels know about ya guy foreal

We sittin down kickin and riffin diggin the sound
Different from the shit dat's been spittin from typical clowns
Finna give me money in the bag and
Hunnies from the mag and
All the other shit they tell the dummies that can rap

But the fact of the matter is I ain't the rapper
They used to using confusing abusing with da chatter
I mean the dude across the table
Reppin for the label
Probly never met a rapper with a business major

So I am able
To avoid the fatal
Fate that every rapper face in they appraisal

Now I got em thinkin even bartering too
It's probly harder when the fuckin rapper's smarter than you

I came through
Same dude
Same crew
Same jew

And I tell these muthafuckas errything that they ain't knew
Yain't knew? I'm about to get a grammy and leave

Michael Jordan in ma genes since I been 23
Except I ain't ball playin at all sayin da bol
Gave all it the game he played it wrong
Made the songs for the laughs cause
Funny was the path but
Now I really wanna fuck these dummies in they asses

Practiced
Tell me I ain't climbing up that rap list
I bet a lot of fans'll listened to this and feel catfished

Damn where da Dicky dat I used to know
The goofy flow
Ma dude where the humor go

Well truth be told I'll put that in a movie show or musical
But now I'm in the studio
And dudes in the booth knew that the jew can flow

And if you listenin to this shit you should know
I'm too cold in this bitch
To be actin a clown
Fuckin around
If I wanna get ma hands on the crown

I'm getting down letting the smile beset to a frown now
The kid up from the burbs bout to settle in downtown

But maybe that's a bad move
Maybe I'm a fucking pussy if I'm letting people tell me what I can't do
Maybe all these rappers wanna wear the same shoes
Get into the game and never playing cause they can't move

Now I'm thinkin what would Jordan do
Back when everybody only wore a boring shoe
If he settled for what every other scorer used
Then you dudes wouldn't ever get the Jordan 2s

I'm snoring through ya muthafuckin tours and tunes
The game needs change now it's short a few

And I don't mean to harp about the Jordan dude
But there's a little bit of him in this adoring jew

Of course you listen to that thinkin I mean I'm great
You mistake thinkin of rap and I what I want a play

J wanted baseball
But he nice at playin ball
When he went away we acting like he went all AWOL

Always got a trade off
I see Jay and Kanye the same way I see Larry David

It's clich
And I know I'm gonn make it
But I dunno if I prefer as Dicky or as David

I guess it's sorta like the sox and bulls
But I can't leave yet gotta lot to prove
But I'm a rock ma shoes watch the toes
And if it hurts then I'm a find Dr. Scholl's

And... one day I'm a find satisfaction from rappin
Or acting or cracking up factions of black kids

Adapting to whatever is in front of me
And like Mike I'm a be aight because of me

One life better think of who you wanna be
It's your eyes doesn't matter what they wanna see

You do it right you the only one you need to please
You ain't that alive till you doin something you believe

Dis the type of shit that's making D
Think twice bout the mafuckin comedy
Cause the mic got a mafucka on his knees

Twerk dicky dicky dicky twerk
Twerk dicky lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Let's go it's your boy LD A.K.A. watch your girl pussy homie
Y'all missed me don't you? I stay with a boner I'm typically hard


My dickheads I'm sorry for keeping you waiting
Just know that I miss you 
Been leaving you all out to dry in the dark
Like a cum loaded tissue 
I woke up this morning like fuck it I got to address all the fans 
I need y'all to know I got plans 
I need y'all to know I been slaving away on my debut
I'm taking a page out the playbook of Jay Big and Dre Nas and Ye
If you studying rap like I study it then
You would know what the fuck I been tryin' to say 
It's harder to wait 
But it's gotta be great 
And then when I drop that shit all y'all gonna be like  
To everyone listening I think that it's cool that we know what they don't 
It's not about if only when and it's fun to be in on the joke
Just did my first shows nervous as shit never been on the road
Started in Philly I signed my first titty I killed dat shit
Still I ain't fucking no hoes (like no pussy it's sad)
A part of the reason is none of the venues equipped with a shower 
So I leave for an hour and when I come back ain't no bitches around 
I fuck with this sound
Rapping like Migos is fun for a clown
I could say anything and at the end of my statement
This cadence will make it profound
Like for example ya man is about to go ham in the kitchen
I'm fixin a sandwich 
All it is is some turkey and mayo but tell me that shit ain't dramatic! 
It's stupid emphatic
Stomach is fucked I been poopin' erratic 
New Santa Monica dude I just moved in in March
And I'm bout to get into some Madness
Don't confuse what my plan is
I never go out 
I meant that my bracket about get sandy
The beach on my house (ehh more like three blocks away)
I'm newly an Uncle 
My bro had baby (he did she cute)
I'll be on by the time she can talk
Her first words'll be  
Can't wait to be famous 
That shit gon' be wild 
I'm lookin' at Jason Sudeikis like who my Olivia Wilde 
I love Anna Kendrick 
She never tweet back (not once ever)
I figure she's busy or think that I'm creepy
But baby I'm not! 
I just have this vision where both of us living like Bonnie and Clyde
That's you as a singer and me as a rapper
We could be like Jay and Beyonce for whites 
That would be the life
I'd buy the Sixers and make you my wife
Nah I'm just kiddin' I've only been smitten
With totally fictional characters right? 
You could be a grouch 
You could be so mean 
You could be the type that need warning with oral to avoid the cream 
That's graphic as fuck 
But some bitches is bougie 
Forgive me I just wanna make this pitch perfect I love all your movies 
I need me some pussy 
I'm scared of the AIDS 
I wish I was reckless
There's rappers that's been getting head up on stage 
I'm way too afraid 
My dick been enraged
But soon when I'm fuckin in public post nut he'll look up atcha boy and say  

I'm just fuckin with the flow
You know I still be on that ya ain't really fuckin with da boy
I got 150 different ways to cut dat
Love rap
Soon they'll be fuckin with the dork like a humpback
Yeah I'm bout to bring the fun back
Every other rapper need to go get and get a dunce cap
Now I got a one track
Mind till I run rap
Mine till I'm done
Wack rhymes better run rap 
Mafucka shit is done wrapped 
You ain't wanna see me come back 
Y'all hot for a summer in July in Arizona
Lil Dicky literally is where the sun at
Knowing y'all gotta show you where the sun at 
All of y'all been bad where my son at? 
Where my son at? 
Where my son at? 
Where my son at? 
Come get spanked lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Aye y'all on the real
I've been like over thinking everything these days
And I just wanted to come in today
And just have no plan and just make a song
So this song ain't about shit it's just what I'm thinking


I should have done this before
I ain't got no plans for it but it's fun to explore
I ain't got no pants on because I'm under record
I been some non-constrictive type of shit
I left my skinny jeans up on the floor of my adorable apartament
Pardon me part of me hard to believe
Retarded part of me smart as a Harvard graduate deaggregate
Well above the averages wondering where my salad is
I hate when they get salads but
It's hard for me to challenge that
I need to fucking balance all the crap that I devour
I been scouring the internet been tryna find an intimate
Place to take an Tinder date
Straight up I'm amazed at how infrequently they pick me
I been spitting great you think again my ass a dinner date
I'm thinking 'bout my gas last I looked at that graphic shit
Was creeping to the E that's a terrible habit man
Honestly your boy been way to busy making dicky shit
Gotta rap gotta get up on the map gotta get a nap
Gotta get it cracking and get a plaque
Gotta go attract the masses but it's such molasses going
Slow as slow can go
I don't even know if I could wait
I just wanna run but I'm growing out of shape
In my PJ's being DJ hit a replay tryna get a little leeway
Overthinking every little thing it's crazy
You ain't got to be rapping so crazy just to persuade the nation
That you know how to be rapping amazing
Bro on occasion you should let it go and let your brain flow
And say whatever come into... oh my God that girl's so hot


Suck my dick ho suck my dick
Suck my dick ho suck my dick
Come suck my dick ho suck my dick
Or at the very least touch my dick


Okay excuse my libido
But the titties on that girl homie holy toledo
I just wanna see the world think of all of it's people
I'm living so regal but wonder what I'd see through a peephole
Into Kinsacha or some shit impossible but
It's probable they got a lot of people feeling some stuff so
Oddly enough I could probly become a buff
I bet they got a show up on Discovery but fuck it
I don't really care out of tupperware plus I'm out of underwear
I swear that doing laundry such a process I don't wanna bare
I want a bear that I can train just imagine pouring rain
And comin' home and there's a panda snoring on the floor
That you can hug and praise hundred days
Since I fucked that lady don't play me it's crazy
But I stay in unless they play shit rotten tomatoes
Lable eighty seven the higher I are I admire art
Well certain kind of art I hate them paintings that
I swear that your boy can make and I'm tryna get in shape
By avoiding cake and I wanna get a place where the boys can stay
With a gate when they visit Dave in LA
What a shame vaca days is dead to me
Instead dude get bread to them
My best moves at your venues and my set playing in your bedroom
That's head to me real shit and my hand doing real slick
Cause I swear to y'all I ain't plan for this
It's new territory but it's real shit
And I'm real pissed this took an hour
Instead of days but it's amazing
What's spontaneity do for ya
And if you don't like it you can...




I like the way this came out that hook is fire
You know what I'm saying?
That hook is the easiest hook I ever made in my fucking life
And that shit is that shit goes lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics

You could say I pull the strings when its cool lil penny
I just hit the double digits fucking bitches
Out in Venice hearing mafuckas bumpin dicky
They treat a youngin like Im Caesar with the ass kissing
That line about a fucking salad if you ain't get it

But I ain't tryn get tossed rap been lost
Like the map been off

Fact you soft like an overcooked linguine noodle

Cats pajamas
Eastside reppin
Westside stepping
You know im the man goddamn it
I just got a handjob damn it
Like from a masseuse
She was tryn fuck I ain't let her pursue
I ain't got 160 bucks
Plus I mentally connect with the hoes I fuck
And this was a whore
I mean a literal whore
Not like massages in porn
This was an overweight asian
With no aspirations
We never developed rapport

Eatin boars head in my other whores bed
Well not a whore but you know she ain't a girlfriend
We still about to get it crackin paul george leg
I got a napkin if I cum within the foreplay

Its about damn time that the boy LD bout to get up in the fun shit
Im the goddamn man like damn erry time a mafucka hit the function
Now the man wit a tan got a plan and I dare a mafucka make assumptions
I dont care I ain't there Ill be damned if Im bout to go and let up on the gumption

Iono the definition fuck is average
I been sittin watching waiting so impatient like its baggage
Claim Im bout to be the greatest naked pictures in my chat
These other rappers fucking lazy word to bangin in a hammock
But yall ain't even hangin
Yall ain't in the running
Boy Im fucking up the track like da youngn into running
Yall are lighter with the fire I want a match
He be like naw Im bout it bro how you get at that
Like these bitches tryn rap

They underwood and to be frank I ain't fronting
Word to Kevin Kevin spacey Im another level
Debatably crazier than shit they play beside the porn that you playing
At a matinee eatin dip n dots
Im getting checks fuck I care that my twitter not

Okay I care a little bit
Algorithm isnt doin its job
Im assuming its flawed
They probably not believing in Hobbes
The nice boy been ballin
White boy been a damn king scott pollard
Gotta tell my mom stop callin
But dog she confused about ma destiny
Making me repeat myself like I was judging spelling bees but
Im just tryna smoke weed grab a quesarito
Got azul by a Spanish chick. Muy bonito
Or bonita
Das ma vida

Keep the rapping tight both ways

Thats the difference when you david to these bigger stars
But you know goliath getting rocked he gone finish scarred
Im bout to break erry record.white girls fall lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Yeah
I feel like people are really weird about admitting when theyre scared
If youre not scared ever youre just lying or something
Youre being weird

Ten days in the bay left
And I dont mean to overthink that
Got a one way straight to L.A.X
And I aint blink yet
I know youd think that
Id of figured out this whole thing
Like where his chink at?
Segue to Lil Dicky getting bigger than a Yao Ming
But can I shrink that?
Where my shrink at?
I dont know what to feel
Everything has gotten totally real
Everything I always wanted right in front of me with nobody near
So its weird that Im overly scared
But Im so unprepared
Holding the beer Im withholding the fear
Not in the clear but Im kind of revered
And yeah I might appear like the chill type
The veneer is not real in the real life
What it feel like?
Thanks giving I was missing I aint even miss em
Girlfriend hella distant I aint even listen
Only shit I really care about is spittin writtens
This is the beginning
Im just getting into the game
My worlds not spinning the same
The shit looking like its bigger than Dave
Its so crazy
But when all this sitting at stake
I cant break even if Im afraid it might change me

Look if you let me
You know I could get deep
Baby hope you ready
Im coming through
Running you
Thats what I do
Just know that its all for you
So what you gonna choose?

Afraid to say okay
And I know Im not gonna get in the way
But Im afraid
Who I wanna be is what I became
But Im ashamed
Aint no coming back
Facing what I wanted but its all fucking weird
At night Im really scared

I aint made from the projects
But you know I treat the game like a project
So you know its not the same kind of progress
Different process but I digress
Other rappers didnt blow overnight
They aint had a nine to five that was totally right
They was all up on the grind from the moment they write
At twenty five hadnt even done a show in my life
Its like damn Im a rapper how did that happen?
I was making ads then back when
Only used to rapping to my Mac then
Packed venues came through like shoot lets practice
Tryin' tell you I aint bred for this shit
Despite that feeling like Im meant for this shit
But like that everything depends on this shit
And I aint betting against it
But I aint had a moment to reflect what Im betting against it
Im next even though its pretentious I sense it
Relentless but it leave me defenseless
I guess I should learn to accept it but its hectic
Oh you want a condensed list?
Im worried that Im about to give my all to it hundred percent
You aint gotta know it all to discover whats left
Pretty fucking intense
And I worry that I got a lotta gall when it come to success
Telling y'all this a hundred percent
But what happens if I fall short of what I call the surest of bets?
Cause whats a hundred percent?
Whats a hundred percent?
Is that it take a lot to make me content
And Im bout to chase around a legend that I fucking invented
While Im neglecting everybody that I love and respected
Because I hate the thought of coming in second
And I dont want to do no second guessing when it come to progressing
Because I really couldnt stomach regretting my effort
When Im at the end and Im assessing if I could of done better
I better be able to be it or never
Or be the best ever
But if somehow Im really that special
Then Im about to deal with mad pressure
I fear that when I finish my assessment I'mma be in depression
Because Ill see a lot of me as regressing
Its obvious to me to be the best a lot of me is repressing itself
I wonder what Ill see in reflections?
I wonder if Ill run into a woman cool with coming in second?
Or if Im bound to be the fool at the weddings?
Alone and regretting the whole thing
Now youre seeing why its so big
What would y'all do if y'all were the old me?
Get involved and you gotta give the whole thing
This is no fling lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









LD A.K.A. the urologist this my year show them D


Okay I'm 'bout to do it all
I don't think I'm stopping 'til it's mountains of my balls
Y'all like oh dear like I'm mounted on the wall
But the way I'm 'bout it 'bout it my accountant getting mauled
His wife 'bout to leave his ass
He been working all night while she give him baths
Actually I'm pretty light like within his tasks
He got bigger clients but I'm nice so just let me bask
These white bitches let me smash
I get scared though no bravado
Third base for the O's like Machado
Miss I ordered this with Avocados thanks
Ey walk up in this bitch like I was born bread
Going deeper with this spitting like some porn head
Picture every rapper laying on the floor dead
While I'm in a chair cross legged eating corn bread
I just fucked a black chick yeah I'm proud
If that's racist suck a black dick
I'm the one who going straight to the top
Don't mistake it it's not that flagrant when you blatantly flop
And plus I stay down like my date gown in this bitch
I'm about to hit the playground straight clown all these kids
I'm watching ladybugs with your lady I got it made like that
Cleaning house like a maid might rap
I don't play with you lame type cats
Say the same shit for days motherfucker if you cold I got flames
You're the ice caps
I bet money y'all don't even know about the ice caps
I don't know that much either


Push the button lean the couch back everybody chill
Time to feel better than the free bread at the outback
This so good chill put your phone back
Feeling better than the free bread at the outback
Eat that shit like we supposed to do
Take a rib get it in while it's toasted too
They be like chill Dicky chill I want another
They be like chill Dicky chill
You see the butter on that motherfucker?


'Bout time someone bringing back that east coast
I got that shit that make a Rabbi be like preach bro
Cory turned Marshawn now it's beast mode
I don't buy her sushi but she still be licking me so
I'm getting pussy like I'm Tebow if he a virgin I'm a cheese scone
Motherfucker I ain't no cheese scone I'm a grown man
I'm just saying that lil David is coming got Perrier in abundance
I'm with a bitch who pushing fingers down
That's saying she want it
Don't look it's head up on the table label that seven nothing
I'm faded snacking on Funyuns while making raps
That's a luncheon
I'm packing a punch and packing lunch and packed in incumbents
Rapping dumber than some tackle football
With no pads to a motherla
That's how you know it's going down
Philly D so you know I keep that Hoagie around
Philly beef we don't fuck with that baloney clown
Y'all made a mess let me just push that old Zamboni around
That's for hockey if you curious
Treat you like my bitches only peep between the periods
Treat you like my dishes only need you when I mentioned
To be eating something viscous y'all deliciously inferior
Dicky sicker than Nigeria
All types of health issues over there lot of AIDS




Don't fuck with me don't fuck with me please don't fuck with me
I wouldn't like it at all
I'm about to buy a monkey and just chill with him
Like in three years buy a monkey and just chill with him
Dressing him well as fuck like throwing overalls on that monkey
Naming him some shit like Greg like some normal ass name
Like just Greg and and like and like really develop a strong
A strong relationship with the monkey
I assume he become one of my better friends
Professional Rapper coming out this fall I feel bad for the game
I feel the hope sometimes I just feel bad for the game
They ain't ready woah I I just got a fucking Hinge match
Like throwing that out y'all just got a Hinge match y'all on Hinge?
It's really irresponsible not to be lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









Wassup y'all?
I realized I never kinda just like full on swagged on cats
You know what I mean? And I was thinking about that
And like damn D why the fuck not? You know I mean?
Your swag is a is a real thing I think
And I've been looking at other rappers swag
And being intimidated by it but like why?
I'm an impressive young man


I guess I could tell you I'm blowing up big
And I'm 'bout to get money
Although I ain't joking America also agree that I'm funny
The rapping you like it
Oh this is some shit I picked up in my twenties
I'm really a writer you knew it it's stupid
I got an eight hundred come fuck with that
Lil ho come fuck with that
Honestly I could have had whatever fucking job
I wanted in the country
But I fuck with rap real shit bro I fuck with rap
And I don't mean it like I fuck with that
I mean it like I run amuck in that
I talk about somebody cock and I buzz off that
Know I'm saying? I'm the man right now
Act like ya man playing right now
Act like I ain't get hundred granding in from the fans right now
Act like I ain't planned that out
Act like I'm not about to get them bitches from the mag
Picture that right cauce I rap nice I'm attractive to that type
Living that life and I'm naturally that likeable
That right dimple not like the left but it's barely worse
Bitches playing marry fuck kill inevitably become Mz. Burd
Go head and fuck them I'm real and my jumper is ill
Y'all got swag but I got reservations
Ya just boys and I'm the voice of my generation
Like I really belive that like I think I'd get us


Run it back homie talking shit pipe down
I don't care 'bout history I'm the shit right now
You can tell me that I'm brash but it's hardly a fight
I've been tryna tell you hoes I ain't cocky I'm right
Swagga on a hundred milligram I can play the villain fam
Put your boy in any room I swear to God he still the man
Lil homie I am Obama
You the man among some bitches bunch of lying Juwannas
Flex run it back homie talking shit pipe down
I don't care 'bout history I'm the shit right now
You can tell me that I'm brash but it's hardly a fight
I've been tryna tell you hoes I ain't cocky I'm right
I ain't cocky I'm right I ain't cocky I'm right
Everything I say I do and I ain't stopping tonight
Swagga swagga swagga swagaa


That's really fun to say like that y'all should try it
If you ever get some free time or on my level


I never done acting but somehow I still get auditions for movies
The last one I went after Bob Odenkirk
And that's Saul if you clueless
The way they react to my rapping
It show me it's bigger than music
At shows they be laughing then dancing
They never seen anyone do this
Come fuck with that
Lil ho come fuck with that
Was in the number one department in the country
I was one up in my class coulda run with that
Biz week coulda run with that then Lil D had a run with ads
Lil D wrote couple for the League got them on TV
Then was done with that y'all high I'm matterhorn
And no offense I matter more
The Rec League like Steve LD winning back to back
With scattered blacks then smack y'all in scattegories
You in a trash like category I'm getting ass no statutory
You seeing red I'm matadoring
Ya rap is boring and wack deplorable
Lack the morals that make mine allegorical
I'm the motherfucking man of my time right now
Got ya whole team looking at the man like damn
That's LeBron that's Durant that's Assange
That's your aunt on my cock say I can't
Even parents fucking with me
Bro I'm so comfy with myself but here snuggle with me
Like please come here and snuggle
See what the fuck happen to you you gon' like it I'm real warm
I shift my weight so your legs won't fall asleep




I didn't even mention how nice I was at tennis neither
So lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics

"Wait Stewart let him talk. Go ahead."

Lil Dicky Lyrics










"Hello how can I help you?"
"Hi my name's Dave Burd. I have an appointment today. it's probably under 'Lil Dicky ' actually. I'm a... I'm a rapper so..."
"Ok and who are you here to see?"
"Uh Snoop Dogg? Says here 
"Oh yeah. He's right down the hall. First door to your right. Give him a knock and he should be right with you."
"Thanks. It's uh this door right here right?"




Grab a seat
Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet
Dave what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem sir let me just say
I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make
I can't lie I been thinking about this all day
All good there's a reason that we called Dave
Let me start with your background
Where you come from?
Sure I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh you talking bout my hometown?
Yeah
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much
I wouldn't say it like that we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain't never had a tool but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad I'm cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping
Yeah and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats you ain't been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man my Bar Mitzvah money
But don't diss me buddy I wasn't one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must've wanted this a lot I had something to choose
Look at that I can say there's something to prove up in your ass
Yeah I guess
That's enough of the past what makes you want to do rap?
Oh my God it's the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It's never boring every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It's kinda healthy
Cool now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh I wouldn't do shit
And I don't even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up rap's like life
If you wanna do this then you won't get far acting like a little bitch
Nah that's my niche!
Don't get offended by this but that's the market y'all missed
That's the target I'll hit
And that's the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
Uh you know I-I think like you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking this shit works right?
Nah like I get that but I-I just think that you know
You don't know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don't mean any disrespect by that
I'm just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant


So what are your biggest strengths?
Well my flow is crazy I can switch that amazing
For example I can be like ain't nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer
Alright alright I get it
Top of that lyrically I'm pretty damn clever 
Got a long bottom bitch called a hoe Neville 
And I blow it from the jump Derrick Rose knee 
You can say I'm pretty smart how I know better
And y'all been winning like Pistorius there's no feet.
Bro I can go on and on
I'm taking over any man like father in laws
OK enough of the punchline that ain't showing me you different from the other guys
Well I don't know if they can run it like that
But ain't nobody else doing funny type rap
What's that?
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you?
I don't get it
Nah it ain't like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like it's a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain't finna just lie
Real recognize real right?
Yeah I guess
So what you trying to do?
Five years from now tell me bout the dude
Well I don't care about the money
Like it's the respect that I'm wanting
Honestly I just want to be one of the greats
For they gotta bring ya boy every debate.
I don't wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell what's your legacy?
Well I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain't gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain't mad at that
Well thanks man that's my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I'm a rap the plaques
And I ain't about to win them back to back
I'm bout to win them like it's back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain't even sold a damn album yet
True
That's a lot of talk from a wiley vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain't a book nigga
Well that's one of my flaws I'm too competitive dawg
No you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it you trying to be better than all
But you ain't shit until cheddars involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain't done shit
But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I'm like this?
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don't know if it's your worst shit
You don't think finding out would be worth it?
It might be it might not
But I'm a put your ass to work kid
Wait like like I have the job? Like really?
Well one more thing let me see if you could put a hook together
What would you do for the hook for this song?
You want me to make a hook up right now?
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
Alright uh okay
Man do the hook!
I'm bout to be professional
Homie I'm professional
Uh maybe like a low voice type thing?
Nigga that shit is garbage man
Well you know I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I'm not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don't y'all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
Sometimes but you know that was some next level Dogg shit right there
Yeah you know I'm just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
Whatever man you trying to smoke a blunt?
Right now?
Yeah
Sure

[Lil Dicky Snoop Dogg & :]
Dope. Juanita bring some weed in here please. Thank you
(You got it Snoop. I'll be right there.)
Thanks Juanita. Super nice woman
Nigga why does everything you say sound so soft?
Uh I really don't wanna be spoken to like that so...
Whatever. Thanks
(Hey I got y'all y'all weed.)
Damn that's some great looking weed. It's just so early

D-Did you just say head?

I mean... Just feels like... A lot right now

But what kind of tea do you guys have?
(We got mint raspberry earl grey english breakfast...)

LD
A.k.a the Time Traveler's Wife


I like to play it cool like I'm not that
On the low who'd assume that I got that
I don't know but the dude with the tall frappe
Looking all aloof being all that
Even Babe Ruth wouldn't call that
I don't even sweat it though
They been hesitant as if my credit low
And shit'll hit them quicker than an edible
I'm 'bout to run for Senate ho you ain't even centerfold
Been on top of cheese I ain't talking 'bout oregano
I'm talking 'bout your cheddar homie revel in that
I'll hit a college and I'm fucked like I'm pledging a frat
They 'bout to silhouette my nuts on American flags
Estoy contento muy estupendo
Better hearse word to rent-a-car Dicky Tony K
Y'all the Le Batard speaking to you lames that's a seminar
I'm straight like a pleasant bar ain't nobody ready for my repertoire
I wasn't getting credit like a debit card
But never mind had to give them time to adapt
I'm kind of like a rap rendition of a fry in a wrap
Just try it as that
You rappers Rebel Wilson's vagina you stank!
I take it back I don't know that ho
And bro they used to


Look around the boy wouldn't raised they head
Now they looking at the boy like the main event
He don't even got a rap sheet looking like a mathlete
How the fuck is he the one that come in with the crack
We like "Who knew who knew?"
Used to look at me like "who you who you?"
Now they look at me like "Who knew who knew?"
Now it's Dicky with this who knew who knew?
Now they look at me like
I am hip-hop Heisenberg
Young boy got dough for a quiet nerd
I am rap game Walter White
You might get killed thinking that he all polite


Buzz around the city coming out of Philly
I'm about to get a milli being me that's word to milli
I'm looking super silly but cooking like at Chili's
You look at me like  but I look at you like 
Oh you new here I'm the bomb
Ok I'm Lebron ok I'm the one
Ok all that shit confusing that's a quandry
What you call a pussy with a movement that's a Ghandi
I'm tryna get better but science preventing
Because I'm undeniably clever the highest of levels
I'm high in a sweater but rhyming like I'm lying in pepper
Don't mind the endeavor I bet I do better than veterans
Cheddaring let him on Letterman
Get him on L and I'm on boy
I think I need a therapist the way I get in my dome
Doing D like they was Syracuse when they up in they zone
Used to load it on chrome now I really ball
Living like a fucking letter man never mailing the song
Though the dime flow rubbing combos in Tom's shoes
With blonde hoes getting Peyton like the Broncos
I'm on ho vanilla looking but the rest of y'all the John Does
It's pretty odd bro cause they used to


Look around the boy wouldn't raised they head
Now they looking at the boy like the main event
He don't even got a rap sheet looking like a mathlete
How the fuck is he the one that come in with the crack
We like "Who knew who knew?"
Used to look at me like "who you who you?"
Now they look at me like "Who knew who knew?"
Now it's Dicky with this who knew who knew?
Now they look at me like
I am hip-hop Heisenberg
Young boy got dough for a quiet nerd
I am rap game Walter White
You might get killed thinking that he all polite

Get up off my dick ho
That's an unassuming dick though
Get up off my dick ho
That's an unassuming dick though
("Who knew who knew?"
Used to look at me like "Who you who you? ")
Get up off my dick ho
That's an unassuming dick though
(Now they look at me like "Who knew who knew?"
Now it's Dicky with this who knew who knew?)
Get up off my dick ho
That's an unassuming dick lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








Drunk faded browned out looking all shady
Two months since I fucked a lady young man dick going crazy
Standard Saturday I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
Then I see a hot girl look back at Dave
Lemme get your cat girl no Hathaway
That's what I thought not what I said to her
Instead I walk up to her like "I know you heard of the kid
You heard what I did you heard of my shit the murderous spit."
She's like "Naw you're being weird what are you talking about?"
I'm like 
Pulling out my phone like a boss YouTube 'bout to get her off
But as I type the y-o-u some porno pop up
I'm like "Hold up how did that's not even me
Like I don't jerk off mobily..."
Then her friends coming up
And wanna know if everything is okay
I'm like "Naw this a rape you can't tell?
Gimme a break please. Get the heck away."
I turned to her "Let me buy you a drink" she like 
Told the man "Two Patron" she like 
Said he tried twice the card got declined
I'm like "All ri- is this a could it be a machine issue?
He was like "Naw"
I was like "Obviously there's something wrong
I got dough like I'm not broke...
I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago."
He like "Dude I don't know."
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
And I ain't talking 'bout with me bro I mean alone
I got one more chance to prove myself so I'm like

"Look I'm athletic girl I've gotten several Rec League MVP's
At my crib I've got some pizza plus a little bit of weed
In my room I've got a TV plus I recently did sheets
Girl I even have a fridge that has the water on the door
Like with the crushed ice"

You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak lemme freak God dammit lemme freak
Just lemme freak please God just lemme freak

The girl from the first verse somehow let me fuck
Fast forward seven months we in love
Some real serious relationship type shit
Despite this I ain't fucked for days
Tried last night but was pushed away
But I've been acting well behaved today I smell okay
Adele Pandora's playing now she laying
On the floor and I'm praying this bitch is horny
I go and give her a smooch
She kissing Dicky back so I play with her boobs
Bad move she don't like that
Bad mood her boss being mean to her
Via email she wanna write back
I'm like 
She like "Yeah what do I say can you just help me?"
"Oh okay what's the context?"
Then she like "Well he talks to Jane before coming to me."
 I said she like "Wow you should know that..."
"Okay I guess I forgot" she like "Dude that's my other boss."
"Okay true so shouldn't your first boss
Go to the other boss before you? Right?"
 she yelled
"Okay well I just don't understand the dynamic then
I don't work with these people." She started crying
"Wait stop what the fuck is this?"
"Naw you don't ever take my side."
About an hour later til' I'm on her good side
We in bed hands on her good thighs
I try to kiss she like  but I'm like

"Look I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee
I've been cutting back on farting tweeting arguing and weed
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet
And supportive aunt during the fourth quarter of the Eagles
Now reward it.."

You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak lemme freak God dammit lemme freak
Just lemme freak please God just lemme freak

Fast forward some more June sixteenth twenty seventy four
Old LD looking old as fuck still with the same ho holding up
But my life sucks legs hurt friends dead real terse
My dick looking like it's tinfoil
Her tits looking like they hard boiled eggs
On top of that she insane
Like I don't even think she knows who I am
Our kids moved away we've been doing the same shit for days
Maybe months who knows probably going to die soon
Pretty scared I ain't even gonna lie to you
Think about it all day on my last legs
But I'm going out with a bang
I got pills they invented back in fifty seven
I took five that's a bit excessive
I look high take a look at my thighs
And good god that's a little erection it'll work though
Now I've gotta find the ho I'm pretty much blind at this point
I don't know if I mentioned that yet but I am
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is I'm like

"Look I don't know if you're aware that
You've been throwing out my shoes
What I do know is I'm sick of doing nothing here with you
All my blood is in my dick I'm probably dying pretty soon
Are you even comprehending what I'm saying
Please acknowledge that you hear me..."

You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak lemme freak God dammit lemme freak
Just lemme freak please God lyrics

Lemme freak! (I don't give a damn what you playin right now this is me comin at you as a man right now lemme freak)

I'm talkin to ya (lemme freak Goddamn it lemme freak just lemme freak)
Girl I smell that pussy across the room
There's no disrespect they could make that shit perfume
Oh good God I'm nasty
Don't look around girl I'm lookin at you
What's good? I'm Dave
What's your name? Where you from? Who you with?
What's your policy on birth control? When were you last tested? Girl I gotta know
If you gon let me hit it raw you gotta go
That would be crazy irresponsible

You know I only get with a bitch I mentally respect
We ain't even gotta fuck unless you and me connect
Minimally I'd like to ejaculate somehow though
Girl I don't think I'm being unreasonable unless you that naive that you thought this was a friend thing
I hope you not a freak so don't moan and spool your body soak and wet
My bad I know I sweat 
Also I won't fuck from the side girl I'd lose like half my dick
Are you good about the pill?
Cuz even if it's foreplay I should know that shits for real girl I got hella pre-cum
Also I'm wondering bout the way that you cum
Like is it external stimulation or penetration-based? Fuck it
You know I enjoy that way
But you know damn well I just want my bed
They gon say I fell I got blown away
I'm a hopeless romantic girl I'm being dramatic but it's just the truth

Wait hold up I should slow down
Don't even know you enough to go down
But if you want it we should go now
And we gon find out if it's great or it's strange

Oh girl I could get you 4 to 8 minutes
Won't force the issue
Bitch it's too crowded
So girl if you bad then just give me that signal
But make it a loud one I'm awful at this hoe on the low you  cut the shit
Girl what you tryin to do?
I got candles Nonpareils and three condoms in my room
The Nonpareils might be old as shit
Like they've been in there for a while
But fact of the matter is I don't want this to be no blip
I'd prefer to fall in love or swear I'm on some crazy shit. 
Like honestly I need someone to save the kid. 

It could be you but first you gotta let me freak just lemme freak just lemme freak again
Girl what's wrong with you?
I need to freak
I need to freak
I need to freak
Like please let me freak
Like please let me freak
Please let me freak right now
Please lemme freak lemme freak right now

Girl we could get married
Like we could be fuckin
A daughter named Bailey
That barely 
We gon eat so many goddamn meals
What's your name?
Girl you better keep them dirty paws off my chicken lo mein

We'll talk the boundaries out together is all I'm sayin
And for the record girl I'll eat that pussy later
Like when I know you a little bit better
But for now it's just too intimate
Like it's too much
You don't even have to give me head either
Like I'm totally onboard with a hand job
Especially if there's like lube or some shit around
In a weird way I actually prefer it to head
There's no guilt
No guilt at all
In fact it feels just as good to me too if not better
I think it's a dick sensitivity issue
At the same time lyrics

Lot of rappers talking that shit not enough doing that shit
Yknow Im sayin? Yeah


People acting like I aint a fucking criminal
Like I aint never doing dirt though
Probably cause the way Im doing shit is clinical
But Ive been putting in some work breh
I see you looking at me cynical stop looking at me
I aint fucking with your smirk ho
Weve been doing shit despicable
But we just keep it on a low for example
Walk in to the movie with my pants full
Twix bag of chips plus a Snapple
Stealing all the shampoos from the hotels pretty bathrooms
Cheating Ive been peekin in the classroom
Looking like a nice guy til I take your motherfucking Wi-Fi
And torrent every single song in my library
Then I drive by very fucking high by everybody
While my lady licking my five inch dick


White crime
White crime
Yeah we bout that
Do a lot of dirt never doubt that
Lot of rap twerps let it shout crap
Let it make their mouth flat
When it come to burd no we spout facts
You 'gon learn what Im 'bout breh


Doing business at the airport
Ask security I aint fraught
Lot of shit up in my JanSport
Six ounce of the face wash 
My duffle bigger than what can board
My shuffle on during take-off
Will I help in an emergency? Yeah sure
Exit row fingers straight crossed
Thinking Daves soft
But I know you see me J-walking
Piss in public no caution
Halloween bucket? Take one fuck you thinkin Dave was
Give me all your motherfucking chocolate ho
At the stop sign never fully stopping though
Filling water cups up with a lot of coke
Egging homes motherfucker a lot of yolk
Not alone up in this motherfucker a lot of folks been doing




Even though the speeding limit sixty five
Im doing seventy five without a seat belt on
And Ive been texting driving reckless
I was seventeen when I first tried a Guiness on the tennis team
We used to haze a lot of freshmen
Lil Dicky put a hoop up in the street
Without obtaining permission
From the city and every Christmas day
Im going to cinemas with single tickets to single flicks
But go to additional pictures sorry but your boy is malicious
And back when I was eighteen statutory raping
This little ho even though we was dating
And if I am taking public transportation
On the quiet train I might have a conversation
Fuck it Im the man
Puitting trash up in some other peoples cans though
At the work fridge stealing can coke
And up at the holiday party Im grinding colleagues on the dance floor
Dick been rubbing against their assholes lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics










Yeah. Man this is the softest thing I ever did.
But... it's about something that's pretty important to me...

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life.

Fuck it I don't even know what I could have done
Looking back thinking 
Wanted you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come.
And even though I had to move I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong.
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs
And she know them pretty soon when your dude on
Running the rap game with that lane.
Always got to be up on that train or that plane
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain or that strain
Wishing I ain't gotta get that fame
Or I'd claim you know I'd give you my last name.
But that blame on me
Chasing something feeling dumb 'cause you all I need.
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I'm never knowing when that's gonna be
And I'm sorry.

It's the hardest rule to follow 
I really wish that I could call you 
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow babe.

If I woke up and I called it quits 
If today I gave up all of this 
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow baby.

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life.

When I'm being dumb and stupid
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfucking jerk face?
Who's gonna let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who's gonna let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missing that.
Always looking at my phone you would give me crap.
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinking back
Listening to you auto-tune in my mic phone making us laugh.
You know the past was a blast but it never could last.
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny
Doing nothing's never nothing when it's something with you.
You know I wanna still talk even text and call
Whenever something going on I be pressing 
Up in the phone til I press the X
Stressed the next one'll best the ex
And you'll forget but it's best.
You the best to me girl always bake me something
And when they ripped off you replaced my buttons.
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
'cause even when I can't say "Love you"
I love you

It's the hardest rule to follow 
I really wish that I could call you 
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow babe.

If I woke up and I called it quits 
If today I gave up all of this 
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow baby.

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life.

It's the hardest rule to follow 
I really wish that I could call you 
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow babe.

If I woke up and I called it quits 
If today I gave up all of this 
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow lyrics

Bruh...

Bruh
A.K.A. stem cells

Errybody know the cat like a dope meme
I got em' buzzing off the crack like a dope fiend
They saw em' come up with a Mac yeah I'm so Steve
Nowadays bitches tryna crack got 'em ODing
Like how them hoes want to get it with L
They know it's cold enough to charge like a letterman sale
If they gon' stand behind the bars I'm in federal jail
I'm going far like a general mail

On that note I got the fellas saying what up the tape what up
The same mothafucker playing with his steak cut up
I'm great shut up the flowing no debate just us
I'm out of shape but I'm straight to fuck
Yeah you know I got a chicken in the condo
I was sick of getting off beat she a bongo
Now she playing with the hard D being Rondo
Drunk and go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow
How I'm'a do?

I got your ex coming next like a W do
I gotta flex I'm the best now I'm being direct
I'm unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press
I'm kinda vexed by the trash like I'm cleaning a mess
Cus they as real when they rap as a Chias a pet
They old news stocks plummet! Men's leg hair they ain't cut it!
Forget about your era Pat Summitt
Finesse writtens
I wanna get a hundred bitches and fuck with the spitting
Religous like a couple of post-marital Christians
I've been official Dick Bevetta a living
You better dig it like you bitches got a mill in the ditch
I'm killing this shit I been kicking like a villainous ninja

My shit is gripping when I run it how the fuck I be slippin
I be intimate with them hoes she never flummoxed
I take chick p and smash I call it hummus
And I be funny with this shit I'm just playing
But still nobody fucking with the kid I'm just saying

Ah! Got a chicken parm on the date it seem
But I don't even know the broad she just grating the cheese
I don't even got a job I just blaze and free
But still they give a boy bands 98 degrees
So come fuck with me
I got a couple hundred bitches doing drugs with me
And I got a couple dozen bitches tryna hug Dicky
And I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me

Hey that's a good ass life
Only thing I got left find a good ass wife
But yo I gotta hit these hoes first don't tell Mom
But in a year I'm'a bend over Michelle Obama
Bruh you know I gotta do it while I'm hot
I'm tryna get blue in most states like Barack
I'm tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock
And put her on D till we O J Watt

I never hit the scene when I do I'm high and wasted
I'm fucking with them jeans love them bitches high waisted
I run around your team you a player but I'm Naismith
And I Command V while you copy I just paste it face it

Hotel got 'em puffing on the L going harder than some hell
You ain't knew it
If everybody had to tell the truth and you had to pick a dude
Spitting better than your dude: can't do it
Telling me damn you got bitches damn you got hoes
Damn you got money but damn I got flow
Damn you got riches damn you clothes
Damn you got honeys but damn I got soul

Hold up. This shit I'm making's always tight it's like a yoga store
They all up in the other boat it's why I'm overboard
I'm taking time to do it right it's like a soda pour
Cus we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for
Damn packing the van wagging the man cracking the ma'am
Packing the stands had them clapping they hands
Tagging they grams Manhattan was ham
Slapping the fans playing havin' the plan
Fans rapping the jams sagging my pants

You see the type of shit I do on the track?
Hot shit like I poop in the jacket
Won't mack your bitch but yo I'm bout to come and mack your clique
Your whole friend group fucking with Dick 
I yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio
They ball all retarded Cuba Gooding up in radio
I long for the moment I can say that's not debatable
I'm past that I wonder who appreciate it like a snapchat
Affleck dunk the dude I'm going hard for the grind but I tuck this move

I made war with the rhymes motherfuck your crew
These bitches going Adolf tryna fuck this Jew
I'm too nice like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo
Twice as in double as fuckable as he was
And dude tries to be subtle and get a cuddle
Venting the troubles and getting the truffles and ending up
Befuddled when she don't fuck him and someone tell him listen
You bugging she never fucking a pedestrian mother like you
So why all the trouble but he rebuttal with
I think I just love her so I would shudder at the thought
Of being anything other than nice

Peeping like a Port-A-Potty
It wasn't even deep dang shit is still a hobby
It's too bad bitches sleeping on me threesome
Cus now these bitches want to help but he don't need none
I'm all time like the Wall at the Bank
You've no shot like you drawing a blank
Honestly you probably couldn't hang man
I've been drawing a blank
Giving you lines while you sitting there and drawing a blank
So go in the rink chilling like stoning and banging
And Im flowing danker than a grower in Napa
Growing the stankist cannabis
Going rapping flowing smacking all these rappers
And showing the total package like my flaccid is growing fatter
Samoan cracker dapper rapper had to keep goin
Yeah that rap is a rap I know you rappers napping don't know it
Theres a dagger pita pappa-tapping on the window
Its a real accurate metaphor of what you having in store
And I be snapping I mean I be splashing on the
Pay me your rain lyrics

And now a message from Hannibal Buress
Blaa uh sorry sorry
And now a message from Hannibal Buress


Aye mane I'm fucking with this shit. It's good to listen to a professional rapper for once but Lil Dicky is a horrible rap name. That's some weird shit; you got grown men having to call you Lil Dicky in the streets like "Aye what's up Lil Dicky. Bars man you be spittin' bars". That's real inconsiderate for you to make that your rap name and it's probably - Is that the worst rap name? I saw a dude named Hogman The Intruder no I just made that up but it's it's not the worst rap name I've heard at all man

Here's some tips if you rappers wanna be more professional:
First of all stop rappin' over your own vocals at your concert. Clear your goddamn instrumental and rap over it I don't wanna hear you rappin' over your raps muthafuckas. Also stop have thirty five people on stage - who are these people?! Are you travelin' with these people or did you hire them locally? Did you pay for their travel? Get all of those muthafuckas off of the stage. It's confusing. I don't like it. You can't do that at other jobs. You can't be an accountant like "Hey I'm about to do your taxes here's my thirty friends just standin' around doing nothing while I do your taxes"; fuck outta here

Also stop talkin' 'bout the same shit. I don't think you have a fresh take on havin' money. I'm tired of hearing about it I don't I don't think it's interesting. These muthafuckas need to mix it up. I think I've heard every perspective on havin' money or I used to have money and I oh I got money I didn't have money I got more money than you'll ever get I never thought I would get all this money I had money now I'm getting more money. Stop getting soo many chains. You don't need that many chains - you only need one chain. Or if you're 2 Chainz you can have two chains lyrics

Ay we gon' save that money

Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave Yung L The Jew Biz Major?
Fuck you know about the world he was raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches homie two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

All of my luggage is Louie V I swear to God nigga
All of my bitches be scared of me I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless I disregard 'em
All of them bitches actin' holy ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin' like a preacher
I can take his ass church fresh as hell no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I can...


Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know a full verse would have been too expensive anyways
I think


I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green homie
Hair cut several months in-between homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air B&B the mother fucker least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer with the sale on it
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpay for it


Ay where the gold at baby?
Ay where the clothes at baby?
Ay where the dough at baby?
In the bank but you know I ain't tryna blow that baby
Ay we gon' save that money

Ay we gon' save that money
What we do? We gon' save that money


I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shiz though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfucking finch though
General Tso half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach tryna smoke
Check the clothes in my drawers I ain't playin' around
It's LD lil boy Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!


Ay where the gold at baby?
Ay where the clothes at baby?
Ay where the dough at baby?
In the bank but you know I ain't tryna blow that baby
Ay we gon' save that money 
Ay we gon' save that money 
Ay we gon' save that money
What we do? We gon' save that money


Every time these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up crazy
Stackin' up all about the bands baby
800k underneath the bed baby


If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing along like
Oh don't double charge for me for that
Don't double charge me we like
Oh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it take a minute let it breathe B
But think about it bruh you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Vs. the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'm a get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kyke know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics










Oh well I'm ignorant
But not to the fact that I'm ignorant of course
I know that I'm indifferent
I don't care to know what I don't
I don't care 'til I'm coming home
And my dad tell me some shit about when he my age he was doing shit
Protesting about something that I forget currently
But that's not the point the point is
To my pot the boy is in the crowd devoid of giving a fuck
I would call his bluff but I've been thinking 'bout it
And shit he ain't wrong though
I don't vote but I think I did at prom though
I don't know about a world if it's not home
I don't even know the first thing about what Obama do
I'm better off telling y'all what Lebron been doing
I don't even know what my mom been doing
I hit her up every Sunday
And we talk but the call's going one way
In the dark if it's not what I'm doing
Never been aware from the start but I knew it
I don't even care how my tech work
If the shit work put it there turn it on we can do it
Funny thing is I could look it all up today
Constructive way to buck behavior Dave hate
And placate the debate within my brain waves
But the shows I watch all start at 8 so


Oh well
It's the season finale so...
Oh well
I kind of have to watch live people are gonna tweet about it
Oh well
But I'm aware of all this stuff I'll figure it out
Oh well


I do care when my phone's dying
Like when that shit's red and I can't text
And I can't check what my fans said
I get mad stressed
Laying in the bed but I can't rest
Till my gram checked wish I cared less
Leave it at the crib I'm a damn mess
I should stop for a day wanna try that shit
Drifting away I wanna ride that ship
Dinner on the table but I'm unable to be tasteful
Underneath I'm a like that pic
Watching the show on a phone filming Coachella on phones
Hoping I capture the moment so I could post it
Don't live in the moment hoping I'm still in control
But I'm praying I'm not alone
All the fans say I'm great at talking to 'em
They don't even understand I am not the man
I just can't go a day with being alone
When I'm with friends though why the fuck am I still on my phone?
Wishing I could look this shit up on Chrome
Wishing I could take a second to stop and reflect it
But someone just texted me


Oh well
It's actually like an important text
Oh well
I'm trying to solve like logistical issues
Oh well
It's time sensitive is what I'm trying to say
Oh well


I was gonna do a line but I sneezed
I was gonna smoke but I need weed
I just wanna roll up and then leave
But everyone keeps on talking to me
Like "How's Mike Will? You know Rae Sremm?
I like  but I really hate them"
Like I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is
I'm passed through and through on loans and my rent
But I just bought new J's and shit
Going way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them
My mom says I should go back to classes
But I'm in the strip club and I'm clapping asses
And my bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis
But she lies a lot and can't kick the habit
I've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards
And they give two cents when I ain't even ask them
Treat them like exams and I need to pass them
I'm twitching dutches I don't do the backwoods
But this gas station don't carry those
And I'm tryna smoke man how traffic
Here's a 20 and some change man lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics









We ain't ever been the mother
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck

We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better
Get the broads like that
It's how we do it!

Hey bitches
Uh I know I can be a little bit much sometimes
But really I just do that shit for the fellas
You know I rap for the fellas
But like this is for y'all

I ain't even strong like that
So average I ain't tall like that

We just trying to show a little respect
Maybe you go for it
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it

We ain't never been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

Honestly I'm like a seven with my hair long
Maybe seven and a half facial hair strong
But I make these bitches laugh and I care for them
I'm the type of motherfucker pulling out the chair for them

I ain't ever been the g at the bar
That get them bitches hella wet just by seeing his arms
You know the boy about the leg work
I plant seeds I'm a mexicano gardener

All I'm saying is I ain't playing the game with these bitches
I ain't mean to em I prefer to show them everything that I can mean to them
Lil Dicky thrive with a friend of a friend and I never hesitate to tell them that I love Rent

I am not a stud I'm a boyfriend
I love love and I cuddle for enjoyment
My dick small but I'm telling you it's nothing by the time
That we fucking they so emotionally interested they really be cumming

Drinking champagne oh you trying to dance babe
We can hit the floor I'm bout to show you how to man shake
We can make a handshake
Keep you safe and walk you to your damn place
Then I got you bouncing on my rubber like a trampoline

What you doing tomorrow? I'm with it
I'm a take you to the zoo and be cordialant witty
I'm a tell you hella stories and be mindful
Bet you get a little horny like the infant rhinos

I ain't even strong like that
So average I ain't tall like that

We just trying to show a little respect
Maybe you go for it
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it

We ain't never been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't never been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't ever been the mother
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck

We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better
Get the broads like that
It's how we do it!

When I get your gchat that's a wrap hoe
Smoke weed eat the pussy like a snack hoe
Bake lays you on top like a wrap though
Bet you think I'm nice in person I ain't talking rap shows

I ain't gonna pick you up at the club
But if I get bout an hour with you bet you in love
I'll ask questions

Oh you did your hair? Little Dicky pay attention
Oh you getting scared? What's the root of all this tension

You know I'd be a hell of a date and if you torn I will split the entrees that you crave
And when you bored I can send you Snapchats for days
And make them personally for you like they all will be based around the inside jokes we develop in time

And if you tired won't initiate the sex it's fine
I can talk you on the phone when you driving alone
And make you feel comfortable enough to take me to mom

And that bitch goin' love it
She goin' tell your ass you legit yo a hubby
She goin' tell your ass need to quit your clubbing and go get that youngun
While I'm sitting with your dad being slick straight grubbing

I can take you out to brunch call me hollandaise
Know exactly what you want every holiday

I can text you like a motherfucker
Wordy and impressive 57 on the Ketchup
Hit you when you coming through

I ain't even strong like that
So average I ain't tall like that

We just trying to show a little respect
Maybe you go for it
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it

We ain't ever been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't ever been ballers
But we getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality
We getting pussy with our personality

We ain't ever been the mother
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck

We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better
Get the broads like that
It's how we do it!
Lil Dicky...
T-Pain... We goin' get them hoes one day man
We goin' places
Like... together?
Not on a date but we're goin' places 
For instance I saw this nice looking young lady that I was attracted to sexually in the grocery part of Target.
And I wanted to put my penis in her vagina but I didn't tell her. And that my friends lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics










Ey ey
Damn
L tapped twice on some ass like grams
I just fucked
Now what I'm doing?

I'm just pillow talking with a bitch ayy
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch ayy 
I just finished spazzing on a bitch ayy
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch


I'm like "Girl that was great talk about a connection
Am I alone in my praise do you share my assessment?"
She like "Yeah that was nice I enjoyed myself"
"Great yeah"
She like "Can you reach that shelf for my phone?
I'll take care the alarm"
I'm like "Oh for the morning like to sleep?"
She like "Yeah we just had sex
What did you think?
I was just gonna fuck you and leave?"
"No I... I hadn't thought that far ahead
But of course can I get you a T-Shi-"
("Oh can you not tickle my hair?
It's just a personal thing it's not you")
"Okay sorry for doing it"
(No no it's just a personal thing it's not you)
"Okay cool yeah
Uhhh so you're from Minnesota?
Only thing I know is that it's colder
Break it down how's it compare
To living in LA?"
("Well I can't compare them they're so different
Y'know what I'm sayin?")
"Yeah for sure"
She like 
"Yeah well you can still compare them but I hear ya
What's the deal with your family? Got any siblings?"
She like  I'm like "Oh what he do?"
She like 
"Oh true
Uhh do you fuck with the war?"
She like ("Huh what did you just say?")
"Huh like just now?"


("No I don't fuck with the war")
I'm like "No I don't fuck with the war
Just don't know how to react to the forces
I should have just thanked you of course-"
("Uh why would you thank me? ")
"Uh... I guess I assumed it would extend to the families but okay
While we on the topic
I been actually thinking about some shit
About the Army and Navy
What if tomorrow is the day
That the fucking aliens came
And invaded our nation?
Like would we even be able to fuck with their shit?
Like do we got the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships?
Or not at all like would they just walk up in this motherfucker
Laughin' at us and blastin' at us
And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate
Without a hint of intimidation?
Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race?
Granted I don't know the alien heart but
You get what the fuck I'm sayin?
Like what the fuck would it be like?
Would they be like Earth go hard?
Or is it just another conquest?
Or would they be like damn earth go hard
They was harder than Simian
You ever talk to your brother about this uh type of stuff?"
Then she like 
I'm like "Well what you think?"
She like 
I'm like "Girl what you mean?"
She like 


"Oh... hold up
Hold up wait
Girl what you sayin?
That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand?"

"What an enormous coincidence that shit would be
Do you see what I'm sayin'?"

"Well the universe always expanding
There are infinite galaxies
Why would we be the anomaly?"
She like 
I'm like "Oh you're religious bitch
You think it's all God?"
("No I know it's all God")
"No I know that there might be a God
First off nobody knows there's a God
Girl I think we should drop this"
("No what's goin' on in your brain right now?")
{ Ayy brain on some other shit though
I been all up in the club for the year hey 
I been killing shit don't mind me
I'm just top flight I could sure use a Sprite I'm thirsty as fuck
Who getting money? That's brain. Who make decisions? That's brain
Who make the hits? That's been brain
Who run the whole operation?
That be brain-}
Brain can you just get back to the issue here
{Uh can you just remind the brain?}
You're such an idiot we're talking about God and if he exists
{Don't call brain names
The brain couldn't recall
But if I'm not mistaken this bitch to my left
Guaranteed there's a God}
("I believe in a God yes")
{So God never wrong
God never wrong right?}
("Yeah that's like the whole point")
"Brain just get there please"
{Hold up
So God made the earth
And God was like hold up this shit is boring
It need more shit
God was like I'ma put dinosaurs on that bitch
Dinosaurs on that bitch
Then he like why I put dinosaurs on that shit?}

"Hold up brain you just did it
God ain't wrong what the fuck was he thinking"

"Bitch the dinosaurs
He made the Earth for them
But then he like nah?
Dinosaurs are just blah?"

"I'ma cook up some blondes?
Like he was way off
I don't look like a dinosaur
Hoe them things thirty-five-feet
I'm like five-foot-eleven" 
"Seen that Bronchiosaurus
That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven
And that's just an expression bitch
There ain't no heaven"
("Ha funny")
"I'm just messin' but if he ain't wrong
I guess this the exception"


(
Everything in life has purpose
You chickens a midget at a circus")




"Okay but think of the root of the argument girl
View how we started this girl like you don't believe in the aliens
You confine God to earth girl I find that shit salient"

"Bitch me neither but that's not what I've been saying"

"Why can't God fuck with aliens?
Why can't Earth just be like a fucking small side project for this guy?"
("Ok look we just don't see eye to eye")


"Yeah there is hard soil evidence girl
Like what's next you don't fuck with Pangaea?"
She like 

{This bitch don't know about Pangaea uhm...}
Brain leave it alone
"I'm starving are you hungry by chance?"
("Oh my God I'm so hungry")
"Yes do you wanna get a pizza?"
. "Fuck yeah I'm on it
Also I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing"

"Okay I just... fuck it
Okay back to this pizza I lean pepperoni"



"No no no this not Dominoes
This legit is high quality meat and shit"
("No no I'm vegetarian")
"Oh right well we can get half pepperoni
And half of whatever you like"
("Uh ew I can't have that shit
In the same box")

("No I'm that against us being gluttonous
Thinking that animals live on this earth to get eaten")
"Okay is it how we treat them?"
("Uh that sure doesn't help")

She like 
"Alright hold up
Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow
Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens
We just set the place to do our hunting intelligently enough
To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want"

"But that's just your God at work bitch
Why we go hard on earth
What you think would happen right now
If you left my place
And there were like three wolves waiting for you"

"Bitch they would tear your ass up
Viciously
Like they would eat your titties" 
 
"Humans are smarter bitch
That's what we do"
She like 
"Bitch that phrase don't make no sense
Why can't fruit be compared?"
She like 

("Right enjoy your pepperoni pizza")
"I will that's my God-given right"
She like 
"Oh that leather one next to the trash?
That's the one right? Made out of cow I think?"

"So you don't eat the meat you just be wearing the shit"

"That's barbaric as shit
Do you come from the vikings?"





"Just download Lyft they are bigger in presence out here"

"Okay the choices are clear hoe
Ubers are not around here at all
Taxis will come but they real slow"
{And the brain gotta poop
T minus five till the brain gotta shit}
("I just downloaded Lyft but it's being so glitch")
"Uh look do you just want to sleep here?"
("Uh no thanks")


"You can sleep in my bed I'll just sleep on the floor"
("Fine you're sure?")
"Yeah it's cool
I won't throw you out to the wolves"
"Oh my God you are so annoying"
"I couldn't help myself
But can you at least throw me a pillow?"


I'm just pillow talking with a bitch ayy
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch ayy 
I just finished spazzing on a bitch ayy
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch


{Brain gotta poop still
Please don't neglect the brain
Please don't neglect the brain}

(Hold on is that my Lyft?)
Nah I got a pizza
Full pepperoni too
So lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








"Actually you know what..."
"I don't I-I will say one thing. I'd rather you sleep in a hotel downtown than sleep at your friend's house. You need a good night's sleep."
"Ha why?"
"Well because you're gonna get up and perform honey."
"Yeah I mean..."
"You need you just I guess I just think you're underestimating..."
"I know you're gonna perform you're gonna perform 3 shows in 4 nights."

"You know you don't wanna get sick. You don't wanna have a cold you don't you know. I'm trying not to be a Jewish mother here but I think you're really underestimating this."
"No you guys are handling it I'd say you're playing your role great as the the Jewish parents of a rapper. I'm curious to hear the conversations that happen between other rappers and their parents I think these are interesting."
"What do you mean by that David?"

"When you say we're handling our role you think we're being uh we're being sarcastic?"
"No I-I enjoy it I think it's funny. I'm just saying like I can't imagine like Puff Daddy or something talking to his mom and she's telling him like "You better get a good night's sleep you can't catch a cold."
"I-I you know what actually you're gonna laugh at me. I disagree with you I think anybody's mother would do that."

"And when Puff Daddy was 25 years old and the night before he was performing I'm sure somebody was telling him the same thing. That's what mothers do. Black white Indian it doesn't matter who we are."
"I respect that but Jewish mothers a little more."
"Yeah lyrics

What's up y'all?
It's your boy LD
A.K.A. The Original Pancake
I'm going the fuck out tonight


Off work 'bout to get trashed
Me and my crew all about to get ass
Sam coming through with a bottle of the Cap
Me and Dean 'bout to tube Mark taking out the trash
Clean up my room bitches 'bout to peep that
Peeing getting groomed bitches 'bout to eat that
Dean shave my neck thanks man I need that
Read through my text then I itch my kneecap
Now I gotta play the game right with Liz
Top prospect met the other night through Tinder
Eight o'clock so I think it's only right I hit her
With a  delivered
While I wait Imma pick a shirt
Ain't nobody wearing plaid so I claim it first
Mark got a little sad cause his favorite shirt's plaid but fuck him
He knows I back off in a reverse
Now I'm taking a shot and we drinking and popping a bottle
And thinking of all the bitches we gon' haul in
Sam say I know a house party and it's popping
Bet Imma cop some weird head Dennis Rodman
Oh yeah we plotting


This is a pregame
It's a pregame
A classic male pregame
Not a weekday
So this is when we take
Shots and we chasing alternate DJs
And that we pray cause


And we all get drunk
And we get dressed up
And we all buy gum
And we all gon' fuck


Aye pour me another shot God damn it
I'm tryna get to a place where I can talk to these bitches
I got seven shots in me three condoms on me and immeasurable hope


Ten O Clock words getting slurred
Another shot Sam's tryna hurry
Mark's not says he isn't worried
He ain't tryna spend hella bread at the clurb
Call him out "since when you using clurb faggot"
Mark pouts something like a herb rabbit
Dean smiles we been doing work
Pretty turnt think he blacked out
Lil Dicky burp loud
Peep phone what the fuck she ain't text back
Pretty close to considering a text back
Spilling Coke on my shirt that's a red flag
Now I gotta change Mark knows put his best plaid on
We debating the top ten in the NBA
Disagreeing alot about Lamarcus A
Shawshank Redemption popped on attention all on
Sam was like "nah the party called off"
I already got a Lyft I'm going out to a bar
Then Mark pulled out a spliff temptation very hard
You know I couldn't resist we blazing now the car here




And we get fucked up
And we all feel rushed
And our plans fall through
And we in bad moods


Man what time is it?
12:24? And the bars close at 2 lights on like 1:30
Let me just think for like a second


Sam like "we gotta go cause the car here"
Mark like "I don't know what's the bar deal?"
Dean like 
Dicky looking like he about to choke on his lamb gyro
Sam looking let down 'bout to go berserk
Mark put his sweats on now he rolling purp
Dean blacked out he ain't even on the earth
I was like "Sam I was with it with my other shirt"
Sam bounced he's like "fuck it I'm out"
Me and Mark smoke a blunt Dean stuck on the ground
Text Liz  even snuck in a frown
I get the spins high and drunk I throw up in the shower
Now I'm jerking off inside a condom 
I text my ex say  
Sam back it's not even one yet he a dumb mess
He about to be a problem
I ain't even tripping I'm Tindering
All of a sudden I'm blinking I'm squinting
It's saying it's six in the morning
I'm stinking I'm still in the same shit from last night
Got a text from Mark saying:
"I ain't mad but I know youll clean the bath right?"




And we get too drunk
And we don't have fun
Then we eat too much
And the next day sucks


Like we really just wake up and spend far too much time shitting
So lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








Yeah
Ay can y'all turn my headphones down? Significantly?
Cool that's good
It was super loud

First of all this shit about me
I ain't made this shit for y'all that's the damn thing
I've been waiting pretty long to get on some shit and rip it for Dicky
So just consider this my damn theme song baby
I've been working hella hard though
There's people telling me I'm 'bout to be a star bro
But when I play 'em some of this they like nobody want the piss Lil Dicky
You the funny kid that's where your card go
That metaphor about my lane if your retardo
I'm bubbling like I'm in a soda word to Fargo
I'm tryna get the fucking fame and it's a tricky little game you gotta play
Sometimes you gotta tell your heart 
Here's the problem I've been having
I wanna make my favorite type of music
And the shit I like to bump is not the type I'm brewing
I be on that "Fuck the world you motherfuckers losing" type of shit
Like all you haters look at what the fuck I'm doing
All my favorite rappers not amusing
And I love my funny stuff I hope it's not confusing
I'm just saying when you doing something time consuming
Every now and then you wanna spaz
Why I didn't go with jazz muhfucka
Get up in yo ass muhfucka
Y'all are trash ye ain't even know the half
I could rattle off a lot of opposition to rap game
But honestly I'm not in the position for that plane
To carry any weight I just gotta carry on and wait
'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight
Hypothetically though I prolly tell you that I'm better than your every bro
I prolly tell you it's subjective I'm more impressive
You pressing play a form of respective
I'm guessing more or less it won't be competitive
Y'all adorable seditive kind of rappers so deplorably editive
Nothing's worse than when a moron's repetitive
I don't get it how is everyone the same dude?
The rookie walking on the court like "Man I can't lose"
They playing Dicky everybody in the room be like 
Playing yo bum ass they be like 
Y'all are bubbles with the rapping
Lil Dicky get it popping you could say bubble rapping
The irony in all of this is I've been funny rapping
Yet the youngin's snapping to the point where all of y'all are funny rapping
Congratulations y'all can write a hook
At my graduation they was saying I could write a book
If a Rotten Tomatoes site existed for us rappers
I would be a 97 y'all would hover 'round a 64
Little Dicky spit that Pixar
Hope you seeing why I really like to spit hard
Only problem is I'm rapping at rappers
To the people that be listening that world doesn't matter
Wanna know what the advantage of the rapper who black is?
The N-word isn't antagonist
Before you get all huff and puff about think about it be analyst
The fact they always use it's no accident
For example I could be like "Go figure
I don't think I'm one to fuck with all you ho "
Y'all can fill in the blank
That don't make it so you don't gotta rap it a rapper
That applies to every detractor
But even if I had a word like  disturbed
It's absurd but I'm looking 'round and ain't nobody verse me
I don't think a motherfucker's ever tried to hurt me
Every one I see has been supportive on this journey
Like where my haters at? I'm thirsty
I just really wanna talk my shit be like 
But y'all ain't shit like y'all don't exist
I could talk about the people that are dicks but I feel like that's whack
That'll get old quick Robin Williams in 
Who the fuck is my antagonist?
Is it you? Is it you?

If it's you let me tell you something
You ain't even got a clue 'bout the shit that's coming
You don't wanna be the dude in five years like
"The fuck I dissed that
Shit was pretty clear how the fuck I missed that?"
You know that I ain't fucking light bruh
I just fucked round and did this overnight bruh
I just fucked around and quit a fucking job 
where I was making triple digits then the comma got involved dawg
This wasn't rapping or trapping
This was rapping over a big ol' fucking house with a family
Who the fuck is listening  but making Dicky so angry?
Is it you? Is it you?
I'm just waiting on some nonbelievers
The writing isn't on the wall it's coming out your speakers
Anybody disagree I'm being so facetious homie I mean it
Forget the website I'm the only motherfucking rap genius
Where you doubters at I'm tryna hear it
Maybe it's the motherfuckers never paying mind to lyrics
I would dumb it down for y'all to try make it more appealing
But the ones who hang on every word think I'm kinda fearless
But even with no attention you can kinda tell this motherfucker killing this section
You can kinda tell this motherfucker still an erection
But getting harder by the minute just admit it it's sexy
The funny fact about this shit I gotta rap 
about the fact I wanna rap about this shit to even rap about this shit
Nobody been sleeping on Dicky
It's only been a year and bitches been sleeping on Dicky
Nobody took over the tape with they first tape
This motherfucker hasn't struggled since the first grade
Add it up there's no excuse to berserk Dave
Can't debate this shit you got to skip you not on first tape
So what the fuck am I mad for?
What's some other shit that I could actually spaz for?
Maybe it's the fact that I've been stuck in this lab for
A hundred fucking days straight cooking up raps or
The fact this shit been taking over every thing in life
I gotta make it so I made the call to leave it all behind
That's my girl that's my world that's beyond being busy
Now the only one that gets to David Burd is Lil Dicky

See I told you this about me
Go on and look up in the mirror see with LD
Who you hate boy?
Only care about me said I'm straight boy
Maybe I'm the one that gotta hit when I wanna murder shit
Y'all probably thinking  and shit
Y'all just wanna hear some LD
But I ain't made this shit for y'all lyrics

"I don't I don't have to worry about that. Like people handle that stuff."




"Uh I probably only would get strippers for Philadelphia."
"Well you're breaking up again."
"I said I probably would only get strippers for Philadelphia."
"But but a practical question in organization is do they allow it?"


"Yeah why don't you take care of that detail for me? Figure out what venues allow strippers. Is that something you guys could handle or no?"

"Well if like I give you if I give you the venue name and number you guys could call."

"I yeah I'll call."
"I'm kidding I'm not gonna have you guys call a concert venue and have you guys ask if you could if your son could have strippers at his show that's ridiculous. I don't need you guys to do that. Of course. I can't believe you guys thought that."
"Well what do you want us to do?"
"Nothing! Nothing lyrics

My own boss
Work less

Man she always taking the most
Conference room every day is the worst

I was zerked I was search
Tryna figure out them alibis

I was drinking with some black guys
Hey I done came up 
Like 
I'm like oh that's my boss she a bitch
She know this
She looking at me every day
Like Dave where you going?
I'm looking back like "Hoe
I hate your demanding"
To print some shit but you don't even know
Now look what happened now who rapping?

Now at work I ask to look at bitches' titties then this happens
Titties looking back at me like "Dicky boy what's cracking?"
I look back at titties like "I need a sec I'm rapping"
Titties looking back at me like "take your time you snapping"
I'm like "woo I'm getting paid for that?"


I'm getting paid for that?
Nah I'm getting paid for that?
I'm getting paid for that?
Nah I'm getting paid for that?


Homie last week I was up in Miami
Got paid to chill in the club
Literally chilling like not even rapping
I think I did a good job
Sat down on Twitter my new correspondence
Is going through all of these wonderful compliments
Used to be scrutinized in all these documents
Now when I sign off on something it's body parts
Titty booty macking a cutie
Got a bag in the back of the room of the venue cause she copped that meet and greet
I got them going down in their prime like Aaliyah be
Used to post up on time no brakes
Got a purp poster on the vine no grapes
Used to have to swallow all the pride
Had to piss out the slacks of the sack in the sweats every day
Used to buy brands now the brands pay Dave

Like I just got a box of Pumas cause they think I'm cool
Watch me mention StarKist Tuna watch my friends get full
I used to sit and wait for Friday
But now my whole week like a Friday


I'm getting paid for that?
Nah I'm getting paid for that?
I'm getting paid for that?
Nah I'm getting paid for that?


Last year I'm stuck up doing shit up in a cubicle
They tell me what to do I'm thinking 
But y'all I couldn't tell them what the fuck I'm thinking
Now they're paying just to listen to this shit I got up on my leg
Got three or four bitches who 'bout to get the fourth down
That's a first I remember when what lunch I picked was all I get
My bitch make that coffee now only boss me around when we fuck
Was missing college but now they bringing me back it's still fun
God damn Dicky you too old to be fucking all these kids
Yeah I know but if you can rap it's a lot less creepy though

I'm smoking weed in public but it never seem to matter
Dump a bottle of water on your clothes and you ecstatic
I don't ever have to set alarms I wake up supernatural
I can grab a bitch's hand and she will scream 
How did this happen?


I'm getting paid for that?
Nah I'm getting paid for that?
I'm getting paid for that?
Nah I'm getting paid for that?


I used to be up in Excel every day with a bitch 
Now I just suck on my dick suck on my own dick man
I suck on my own dick every rapper do it
Just a thing an inside thing I learned
It's absurd it's like I'm in the industry now so I'm seeing shit
Every rapper suck they own dick lyrics

Lil Dicky Lyrics








Hey man... man
Hey... hey

I guess y'all on board
Young Man couldn't leave that shore
Had the life they made for him 'til he seeked out more
Boat rock couldn't see that storm
Held it up dawg
He know he close
It's too late to jump ship 

Aw damn! Aw damn!
You that motherfucker shit
I know
This here became a trip Cabo
Up in the womb but you can feel it when I kick it I know
And you too  must be rockin' with Lil Dicky Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just prayin' I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know

I saw the world like 
Damn near fakin' on the side
Let me take you on a ride
Let me tell you bout the one who couldn't take the 9 to 5
Use to take the 95 down to Richmond
Bumpin' Jigga up in the ride
Use to think along and drive
'Bout my drive
Used to wonder why
Used to wonder when the world'l see like I'm seein' mine
Use to whine
Use to wanna shine
Used to wanna dine
Used to talk to bitches in my mind when they were walkin' by
"Girl what's happenin'? Girl what's happenin'?"
I ain't really 'bout to get involved that's what's happenin'
Errything I knew was unevolved like a Baptist
Layin' on my matress
Prayin' I could have this and
Now when I get Tinder matches
They think they've been Catfished
Now I been controlling how we livin' like a facist
Now I got this weight up off my shoulders like a strapless
Remember this shit was hapless
Remember the day it happened
Aw you the shit Dave you be killin' everything you did
Got the whole world talkin' all about what you did
Got your old girl talkin' all about what you is
Got your old world lookin' like it's his you ain't here
I been fuckin' for the fuck of it
And one of the bitches I been fuckin' with
Been wondering how I can work this much and stomach it
She wonders what I want from it
I said 
She like "Nah just do it"
She a psychology student
She always followin' up
Find the guy to be amusing as fuck
Usually I'll answer her truthfully
But truthfully I'm unusually used to being unusually good at internalizing when music is not provided
But I humor hoe
Ask her if she ever saw the Truman Show
She like yeah
I like well when I saw that shit I was convinced I was livin' like Jim
A similar situation where I was the basis of everyone's entertainment
Like really up in the basement talkin to y'all
In the mirror because I thought Lil David was some American hero
I know it's selfish and all
But I just felt it's my call
I was a ten year old then
By 2010 I was wrong
I'm like

"Aw damn! Aw damn!
You the motherfucker though"
I know
That shit became a trip Cabo
Up in the womb but you can feel it when I kick it I know
And you too  must be rockin' with Lil Dicky Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just playin' I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know

Twenty three bars up in my apartment
I am debarred
Gotta do this shit
I gotta recharge
But I gotta be smart
Movin' up that ladder company
Star fuck it that ain't nothin'
I am *the* star
Spittin' like a retard
Work was like a prison
I'm just seein' bars
My boss was all up in my camp
And I'm just seein' Lars
I been a heavyweight Muhammad Ali
And if he can mold that out of 
Then I can turn the Lil D
So now I'm snappin' like I'm Truman
But off and on
There's always somethin' in the way
I should be often gone
Girl I'm sorry if this draggin'
I just need you to imagine
Bein' stuck up on the land without a captain
When everyday is average
And everyday you feelin' like a captive
And feel like somethin' seriously lackin'
And then you fear what could happen if you just leave it on the table like napkins
But yo you really fearin' hitting them rappin's and leaving everything behind
Cause you don't know what that horizon brings
But girl you gotta know what kind of fish you is
Survival instinct kicked in
Sink or swim
I flipped a playlist
Quit my day gig
Now I'm on a boat Lonely Island
Irony and you still been tryin' to figure how I work this tirelessly
But girl
This is everything I've thought
This for everything I've fought
This for who I am to me becomes to y'all


They tellin' me 
But I just be tellin' them  
I just be tellin' them  
I just be tellin' them 
Tell 'em I'm gone 
I just pretend I ain't scared 
Don't even know I was there 
Don't even know if I care
Cause girl this is Truman approachin' the wall
Until I'm me I am nothin' at all
Until I'm free I will not see beyone
I had to be who I was all along
Ay 

I think I mighta broke it down
Hoppin' on the fuckin' steps like ain't no around
Open up that door you bet ship ain't goin' down
Guess the only thing left is to take a bow

Aw damn! Aw damn!
You that motherfucker shit
I know
This ship became a trip Cabo
Up in the womb but you can feel it when I kick it I know
And you too  must be rockin' with Lil Dicky Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just prayin' I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know

 Fuck! )
That felt good
Well that's all I got
The show is over as they say

Honestly I just think that part in the Truman Show where his boat hits the wall is really the exact
Moment that I'm at in my own life right now
Uh... metaphorically of course
And I'm ready for - I think I'm read for it
Like I've been thinkin' about it I think I'm ready
I mean if I'm being completely transparent with y'all
Uh like my lifestyle hasn't really changed that much
Uh you know considering uh where I think I'm at musically
Like I'm still at the point right now where pretty much any bitch that tweets at me anything remotely flirtatious
I have seen not just one of your pictures I have seen the entire catalog
That's the type of shit that's goin' down over here right now so...
I am definitely ready for that uh next step y'know what I'm sayin'?
I think it's close too
I think it's close
Like uh Diddy tweeted about me
Uh y'know that... I don't know if he handles his own Twitter
I would assume he probably doesn't actually
But like I'm so confident that I feel as though like me and Diddy will have a moment just about this outro
Like when we're both sittin' next to each other smokin' cigars
And bein' like "Ay remember when you said that shit on that outro?"
Like and I'm like "Yeah. That's this is the exact moment I - I did that for y'know what I'm sayin'?"

Bring the - bring the beat back up. I don't know why
Like keep loop everything. I wanna be talkin' for minutes yeah uh y'know what I'm sayin'?

Like uh shout out my Macbook Pro
Had that shit since '09
I made my first song ever on it
Like when I called myself Lil Dicky
I made my like fuckin' album song on that shit
And we survived baby

Uh shoutout Allen Iverson Larry David Will Smith and Kobe Bryant
For makin' me the man that I am today
Both on and off the court

Shout out my mother
What a great woman
She's so mad I recorded these conversations
She - she honestly went crazy
It took so much convincing to allow this
But she's awesome
She's adapting to the rap game as we all are

Look I just want to get this to a place where I can sell TMZ pictures of my actual asshole
Heh y'know?
Cause well I I think that'd be such a feat
If I could actually create like an alt alias
And sell TMZ pictures of my own asshole
Like profit off of that
That I would totally do it
I don't know why Seth Rogen's not already doing it
I don't I'm seein' the signs that it's not I'm
I think I'm seein' the signs
I hope I am
If I'm really just misreading all these signs
Then I am 100% gonna have like a legitimate nervous breakdown
Uh at some point very soon
So we'll find out about that
But I see some signs
Like like I really am not fuckin' that much
But like the other day I did fuck a bitch to music
Like I fucked a bitch to some Miguel
And that's kind of new for me if I'm bein' real
Like I had never actually done it before
But I was feelin' like I was some king shit
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
So I was like "Man Imma fuck this bitch to some Miguel right now"
Uh actually to be completely real to you I I will never fuck a girl to music again
I found the whole thing to feel like completely cliche
Like I don't need my emotions dictated to me by like music
It makes me feel like I'm in a TV scene
Takes all the like realness out of the moment for me
Like actually was actually super weirded out by it

So but still like I am about to let my hair down
And I don't know I just feel like it's all comin'
I feel like like I'm literally like about to find out about everything
And it's exciting
And I y'know I I had pinkeye last week
And I remember thinkin' that as I like was like real down
Cause I was like trying to keep recording and shit
But I was thinking 
And he would play through the pinkeye
So that's why I'm in here
I'm still not fully recovered y'know what I'm sayin'?
I I'm definitely clearin' up
Like it's totally on the upswing
But I just want you know I did record this shit through pinkeye

Alright I could talk for fuckin' years
Legitimate years
This is an outro to an out
You see how long I talk with outros to songs
But goddamn
Look I need to get out of here
I'm 'bout to go take a Khalifa
Rest up
That's right I did invent that phrase just there

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
I also invented 
But I get no credit for it
Uh oh shoutout to Dickheads obviously
Fundin' this whole operation
Whatchu know about a Kickstarter man?
Whatchu know about the best fans in the world?
Seriously
Thank you guys I appreciate it
Honestly you made my dreams come true and that's fact
Couldn't have done this without y'all
Uh I'd like to shoutout my dick
I know y'know we haven't had the smoothest relationship
But I feel as though by kind of putting our issues out there
Like we have become something bigger than we could have become otherwise
And hopefully soon you will be rewarded for your patience
And I will be rewarded for my patience
I and I respect you
I'd like to shoutout my brain
My brain got the hardest verse on the whole goddamn album
I hope my brain starts gettin' some feature looks
But he don't just hop on shit

Fuck I I got nothin' left
I'm out
I'm a professional rapper
Long live LD
And in case I don't see ya

Do the math Brain about to buy a new dick
Brain don't really give a damn at all 
Lookin' at your bitch like damn he wrong 
Lookin' at your dick like damn you soft
Lookin' at Lebron James brain like what's happenin'

Why my girl look like she working for a Macy's?
Why your bitch lookin' like she work and shop at Ross?
Where I know you from?
I seen you I'm just struggling to place it 
Why I got a bitch butt-naked in the bath tub while I'm in the shower that's adjacent?
I can see her contemplating masturbation
Hope she doesn't that'd be weird
But I get it 
I also got the neck so long like a giraffe
Suck on titties like a calf
Went a few rounds like a draft 
Still got bitches
Still got bitches (yeah yeah)
Still not different

I swear to God I'm bout to fuck Julia Roberts 
I think a star is afoot we should converse

Never even done cocaine

Never even tried it you know I ain't lying
Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it never even tried it
Never even tried it I've been close-minded

Party girl party girl
Out in LA with a party girl
I was all good with Bacardi girl
Now she tryin' to up the ante
I was kinda drunk and handsy
Johnson looking long like Randy
Hoping that my pitch is strong
Now she's like 
Ew chill I don't do that 
Poured a rail and she blew that
Now I'm scared I look pussy
Spark the blunt 'cause I do that
She was sniffing that Tom Hanks
I was just sipping Chris Brown
She keep on sniffing that Zeus 
I keep my eyes on the ground
She like 
That's some bullshit (yeah I know)
Just do a line of this Betsy Ross
I started thinking can't deny I'm a pussy
Like as a child I was so dissmissive of the baked potato 'till I tried that shit
Now the baked potato is my favorite kind potato
Now she got me wondering what else I left on the table
Twenty-eight I still ain't done no anal 
And I'm unusually skeptical
But man oh man this bitch was raw
So I asked her for some Molly
She like 
I'm like 
Crazy 'cause I

Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it never even tried it
Never even tried it you know I ain't lying
Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it never even tried it
Now I'm doing Molly I hope I survive it


Brain
Flippin' a bitch and I'm poppin' this shit and I don't really feel it yet
He never done it before and I'm worried I'll feel neglect
But I ain't trippin'
Balmain Brain 'bout to get to kissing
I'm sauced up fucking with this breezy boo
Haven't eaten since four man I need some food
Why these broke people looking at me? 
I'm feeling good and happy
Hold up the Molly kicking in now
I think I should sit down
Brain for the win now
I think we should dip now girl let me know 
Brain overwhelmed losing control of this front lobe 
I was G'd up now I'm T'd up
Like a ball playing motherfucker in Atlanta
Shout to Dwight Howard
In case she didn't let him 
And now I'm puking
Girl I blew it but I was just doing my j-o-b


Brain what the fuck is going on?

The molly got me shakin' and clenchin' on the jaw
It got me going crazy

It got me going crazy

How the fuck you blame me?
You the one that popped MDMA
When you never ever even done cocaine
Never even done cocaine
Never even tried
Oooh Brain


I never even done cocaine
Never even done cocaine
I never even tried it never even tried it
Never even tried it you know I ain't lying
I never even done cocaine
I never even done cocaine
I never even tried it never even tried it
Never even tried it I've been close-minded

I never even done cocaine
Never even done cocaine 
I never even tried it never even tried it 
Never even tried it you know I ain't lying 
I've never even done cocaine 
I never even tried it never even tried it

LD AKA 'Cream'

People are always saying to me
"Hey Cream how do you come up with the stuff you come up with?" 
And it's not even me
It's Brain!


Fuckin' with these hoes I'm a popular dude
Got some hot top like the popular do
Rest in peace B.I.G. but I'm Pac and I'm smooth
'Bout to go after two I'm a hoe after two
And look I still get chose like I'm rockin' a suit

I don't know if I prefer like a blonde or brunette
You get held up pickin' locks robbery moves
I be scoffing at you like a prosperous jew
Hold up Brain 'bout to spaz
What the fuck you want Brain do?
Come through and the club's all crowded 
Fuck you want Brain do when he can't even move when he in the club
Brain gotta make moves 
Brain got great moves 
The Brain fuck with field hockey 
The Brain knew Bin Laden

How you wanna do it how you stoppin' the kid?
Just get it off your chest rockin' a bit chomp at the bit
I got to get another property monopoly shit
And y'all sketchy motherfuckers like a comedy bit
I just met with Netflix on some comedy shit
Then I went to Costa Rica on a tropical trip
Parents worry 'bout the price started talking and shit
But it's a nominal hit  make it back in a jiff
Because


Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' and whippin' and whippin' and
Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' it up
The Brain thought of that one
The Brain whipped it up Brain whipped it up


These rappers like Barry Melrose
We don't dislike you we just don't really care

The Brain came through with a bottle of the Nair
Made my bitch rub it all over her pussy

My bitch likes Bun B
That's some new shit to me
Bitches that I used to be fuckin' with would only fuck with Houston's for grub and they frumpy

 The Brain heard about tidal wave in Seattle
They say it's imminent still no-one moved
The Brain just don't know why they don't think it matter
Humans can't breathe underwater what gives?

Y'all wanna know why I stopped eatin' pussy? 
'Cause I looked up the facts
If 85% of us have oral herpes who am I to say that I don't? 
And if I get oral herpes on the pussy and we fuck
Then I'm fucked 

Fuck you want Brain do?
He know all the facts what the fuck you want Brain do?

Middle of the pack all you rappers is gum
Going in with the trash I be chewin' 'em up

Brain fucked a thoroughbred down in Preakness
Like a horse I ain't talkin' 'bout a bitch with a ass
Brain hear it all the time he a genius

Hey you a savvy motherfucker Brain giving you that
I'm the type of motherfucker on a call with a CMO
Bitches tryna catch a glimpse bitches at Sia shows
Girls look at me and think 
Bet they heard through the grapevine
In daytime I take dimes like a paid line and make time
It's they prime hittin' on the jew like it's a hate crime
Speaking of that they won't even book me in Dubai 
Apparently for jews it can be hostile
So my new goal is to buy like Dubai like
All of it
I don't know I just wanna go there


Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin'...
Oooh Brain is overwhelmed he's fuckin' up ohh Brain

Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' it up
Brain just been whippin' and whippin' and whippin' and
Brain just been whippin' it up

Feel like we goin' crazy
Real life we goin' crazy
Suck me fuck me lyrics

Focusing just a bit more

What whatchu mean I'm f-

Whatchu mean?

No it sounds cool and all I'm just saying
Like you know
Maybe it could be a little less random
Or if you-

Man don't get all high and mighty at me bro
My shit a wave bro
Fuck outta here

No totally and I like your music
I think it's-- I like it
I just think I'd love it

Man

Let's just come up with some ideas for you

Like song topics and shit that's what you sayin?

Yeah exactly let's brainstorm some topics

Ohhh no you said brainstorm?


Uhh yeah just a brainstorm

Brain gotta think
Brain don't even know

What's going on?

Usain Brain they call me Usain Brain cuz I'm fast

Brain in the club
Brain thinking up stuff
Brain pourin up
What's going on man?

Tell 'em Brain! Heyyy!

It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Time to think of some ideas
It's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill
Oh it's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Time to get my ass in gear

Brain don't even know
But the Brain don't even know
But the Brain don't even know

What the fuck is happening?

Brain so overanalyzed
Scrutinizing every single move

So weird

The Brain had no further questions Your Honor 
Well I can testify

There was a brainstorm
There's a brainstorm
Time to think of some ideas
We in this it's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill
Oh it was a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Everybody know the drill
Woah Nelly it's a brainstorm
It's a brainstorm
Better bring your best ideas


What the fuck was that?
Did you even come up with anything or no?

No not yet but the process is underway now
So any minute
I should be cookin' I should be whippin' it up

Alright take your time
It's your process just let me know
I'm always down to help whip or whatever you need so
I'll be I'll be in the kitchen

Whatchu want whatchu gonna make?

Nah I'm actually just gonna clean the kitchen

Oh alright bet

You say bet now?

Yeah
Alright lyrics

Hey man the way these bitches when they fuck on us
This shit the friction in this shit hurt bro
You gotta talk to them bro

Ok

I tell her I tell her I tell her
Chill girl. We should chill girl
You been humpin' on me too fast keep it real girl

The brain on the same page

Fucking another one "Damn LD how do you slow a hoe down?"

I'm 'bout to show a hoe how

Baby girl let's slow it down 
Drill her when I'm in it I admit it
But I hate it when these bitches ridin' dick super quick
Aggressive ass movements hurt my dick 
I don't know why just the way my dick was built 
Getting the impression when they get up on erection that they think it'd be impressive just to go full tilt 
0 to 100 bitches going full Wilt
Seriously afraid that my dick might wilt 


Out and 'bout with my Spanish bitch
Throw that hoe a middle management at the Radisson
Why she hoppin' on the brain like a savage bitch?
She fuck me ravenous
I'm assessing damages shit
Coronating all the money bags
Coronating all the fucking ass
Orating I don't like it fast
Pores chafing when she fuck me fast


 But I got a dick and I'm tryin'a do it like this

Let me fuck slow on you girl
Let me fuck slow on you girl
Where them hoes lookin' bomber than a landmine?
Will my bros that be fuckin' on 'em stay alive?
Let me fuck slow on you girl (chill girl)
Let me fuck slow on you girl (said chill girl)

And the Brain got them bitches on stand-by
And the Brain getting hungry Raisin Bran time


Chill girl we should chill girl (we should chill girl)
I've been looking at them ol' breasts since they real girl
Thinking through the words like I read it
Esketit like a Brain if you see a tight end then he toss like Bennett
1 in 7 down going down like credit
Don't get shook like lettuce 

Brain tryin'a get fucked
Brain tryin'a get sucked
Brain been lit for a month
Fucked a bitch on that kiss cam
Yeah I been doing my thing
LD now they been checking for Brain

Hey we should go flirt with this dame kay?

She should come flirt with the Brain


But this bitch has it all like a Genuardi's
Now my mouth is watering just like my spot for Hardee's
I'ma go chill with the girl be back  all day
Young L I got a knack for hauling that
I might even get up in the bathroom stall with that

Please you ain't been fucking like Brain

I got this shit like a car alarm when that car is parked around thieves 
Got this shit like gardener that's in charge of all of your trees 
Young LD got a poppin ass shirt check
Backstory kinda poppin where's my work check?
I might even go up to the bar and cover her check

And then you'll say what?


Let me fuck slow on you girl
Let me fuck slow on you girl
Where them hoes lookin' bomber than a landmine?
Will my bros that be fuckin' on 'em stay alive?
Let me fuck slow on you girl (chill girl)
Let me fuck slow on you girl (said chill girl)

And the Brain got them bitches on stand-by
And the Brain getting hungry Raisin Bran time

I fuck lyrics

Brain Lyrics










Brain you're so cute

Aight

I just..I felt really in the moment there the way the light is just glistening off of your creases

I...I'm tryna focus bro

Okay okay. Can I do one song like without you on this project?

Without me?

No it'll still be your song but you'll be more like a DJ Khaled of it. Like..the organizer the facilitator as oppo- like you pick the rappers but I just wanna go really hard like really bad without you be-

What makes you think I'd even pick you bro?

Well c'mon Brain. We both know that you would pick me

Well this shit better be hard lyrics

LD
AKA homicide
Yes homicide

OG's knew I had it poppin'
IG lookin' Photoshopish (it's lit it's real)
They just can't take charge so they floppin'
New shit looking like it's knocking
Rap game not a game well I ain't broke so it's cast off
Really I been keepin' shit a hunnid like the Cubbie tryin' to close it with a fast ball
I don't even do this shit for money but they buying it in droves like it's half-off
If Dicky gotta show out there
You know he 'bout to show out there
Rol on my arm
Russ on a farm
Piston new guard
They put the boy on the Jumbotron
Just to pump up the crowd
At my ten year reunion like look at me now
Having good sex on the reg
New Tempur-Pedic my bed
All of my lawyers are black
Shit is ironic as hell
But I guess that what happens when Jews started rappin'
Used to have turtles no wonder I'm snappin'
Used to commercial right used to play Madden
No wonder they let me do both for a bag
I was not in a frat I had never conformed
In a 2000 cab I had never performed
I ain't takin' no L's
Fuck what you sell
I barely pay for my drinks doin' well
I tell 'em there is no need for the glitz
I don't need sparklers they know that I'm lit
I'm on top of the world fuck all these girls
I prefer momma to play with my curls
I can tell all of you rappers ain't thorough
Head hit the pillow and boom it's tomorrow
But how can you sleep? (ew ew)

How can you sleep? 
How can you sleep? (gross how?)
How can you sleep? 
How can you sleep? 
How can you sleep? 
How can you sleep? 
You still asleep


How many bitch ass rappers I gotta slap 'till they put on Worldstar?
Even though Q passed away
Pull a '38 out of my pocket and then cock it
Leave a nigga on an island like he in Castaway
Cock strong since them old Doc songs 
Like an old Pac song outta my mind
The lights on but I'm not home
Something is wrong with me
I done brought six strippers from Vegas home with me
Trees bought game to getting blown with me
FaceTime with Karrueche they on the phone with me
Tell K good night I'm hype I might ignite
Plastic cups Promethazine and Sprite
Man I don't really know who's song this is
Who's weed I'm stealing and who's bong this is
And I don't really give a fuck 'cause I keep the ammo tucked and you can keep on swinging from my nuts
But don't say I can't rap like I'm not a Rap God
Like I won't break your fucking favorite rapper's rap jaw
I don't give a shit
Big or tall short or small
I'll cut your dick off and sit it on Trump's wall
Then spraypaint  it's evident
Hip Hop dead them new niggas irrelevant
Different color braids you niggas stuck in the maze
Ain't grew up by a beach to say you ridin' a wave
Man I'm so glad that Guwop out
And rap fans still give a fuck what 2Pac 'bout
I'm right here I don't give a fuck who hop out
Don't let Mark Zuckerberg get you knocked out
And don't try me over IG
Don't try to be subliminal and get it by me
I'm a criminal I'll leave you hooked to a IV
Next to Jimmy Iovine over hood shit but-


We could start with rap shit
I ain't never lost at that shit
Let me clear it up Proactive
I could walk up in this motherfucker looking everybody dead up in the eye like we can rap for that shit
You'll get embarrased
I'll be in Paris don't compare us
Flow the rarest
Got bitches in the bed room over sharing
Got an Aussie and a Brit like Im going with Sharon
So apparent Heir apparent
But I don't want it next
Someone tell Complex it ain't complex
And what you lookin' at is now like a Timex
I am checked the on now off the clock like compound
I'm really adamant you're really adequate
I'm really passionate I'm Billy Madison
I'm the motherfucking graduate
Twenty ten with a pen I didn't plan this shit
My plan legit I manuscript it
It was living by the candle stick
But for the plaques I had to mantle it
All my friends thought Dicky was a joke
Now they tryin' to see a show
Now they out of breath tryna speak good
I remember everyone that didn't think I could
Every publicist who thought that I was mocking hood
Look what what you were tryin' to stopping jerk
Look who tryin' to rap now
I don't even fuck with you
If what's done is done how come I ain't done with you?
And if it's fucking done come on how dumb is you?
Let me get another tissue
I'll be crying 'till the fucking bank pull that card again
From Charlamagne to Busta Game to Puff to Sway Questlove T-Pain from Snoop to Chainz it's all the same
Ain't no debate they know who fake they know who great
You don't know your place
Cameras around me they don't know your place
Shooters around me 'cause I entertain
I got 'em shooting they movie
I could meet a bitch on a Tuesday
Girls come to me
Don't got jewelry
Don't feel bad when I bust in my jacuzzi
Don't eat ass but it still be lookin' juicy
Front page coming at you like a news'ie
Hoes didn't choose me now I'm choosing
Now I got a Jap on knees like sushi
Lil' dick got vert no Uzi
I might just pop that coochie
